# Exercise: Drawing Local Connections



{% hint style="info" %}
## Stop and Think:

* Which features of your study site are permanent \(always there\) and which are transient \(temporary\)?
{% endhint %}

Now that you've visited your local study site, let's take a closer look at how elements of each of the four main components of the Earth system interact with one another. For example, how does a tree \(an element of the biosphere\) interact with the soil in which its roots grow \(an element of the pedosphere\) or with the rain \(an element of the atmosphere\)? Energy and matter are continuously transferred among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere. By studying the flow of energy and matter at your local study site, you will begin to build an understanding of how the four components of the Earth system work together to create and maintain Earth's unique climate. In this lab, you will use observations from your visit to your local study site to draw interconnections on a photograph and then to make a diagram of the flow of energy and matter between components of the Earth system at your local study site.

After completing this investigation, you should be able to:

* analyze a photograph of your local study site with respect to Earth systems;
* annotate interconnections among components of the Earth system on a photograph;
* translate your analysis of your study site into a diagram of energy and matter flow among components of the Earth system; and
* interpret and evaluate diagrams of your local study site.

### Part A: Annotate a Photograph of Your Study Site

To annotate means to describe with short notes. Work with a partner or in small groups to annotate your study site photograph in the following way.

1. Writing directly on the photograph of your study site, label the four major components of the study site system: atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere.
2. Using the list of interconnections you developed in the previous activity, write short descriptions of the interconnections among the components of the system that you can see in your photograph. Follow these guidelines:
   * Use phrases or short sentences with verbs.
   * Make sure you are describing _connections_ or _relationships_ between components of the system, just as in the list of interconnections.
   * Write as clearly as possible. Remember that other students must be able to understand your work.
   * If you run out of space for your annotations, put a number next to the feature in the photograph that you're writing about, draw a small circle around the number so that it will be easy to see, and write the annotations on a separate piece of paper. Attach the piece of paper to your photograph.
   * If your photograph does not show important features that you know about at the study site, you can include them in your annotations in the same way as suggested above.
3. As you work on your photograph annotations, here are some things to consider:
   * Heat is one way that energy is transferred from one place to another. What happens during the day at your local study site when the sun is shining?
   * Biological process like eating, moving, and dying also help transfer energy. Do you see any of those here? Where is the energy going?
   * What things at this location are capable of moving from one place to another? Trees? Leaves? Soil? Rocks? Water? Some of these things might be moving really slowly, but they are still moving. Can you find anything like that?

## Stop and Think:

* What do you think are the characteristics of an effective study site diagram? Explain.
* Draw a diagram of some other system \(e.g., a sports team, a group of friends, a car engine, etc.\). On your diagram, label the main parts or components of the system and ways those components interconnect.

### Part B: Draw a Simplified Diagram for Your Study Site

The different parts of the Earth system are connected by cyclic flows of energy, water, and important chemical elements like carbon and nitrogen. Each cycle consists of _reservoirs_ \(places where energy, water, and elements are stored\), _fluxes_ \(the movement of matter from one reservoir to another\), and _processes_ that change the form of energy, water, and elements.  
  
**Examples:**

* **Reservoirs:** clouds, oceans, soil, trees
* **Fluxes:** precipitation, transpiration, ocean currents, wind, river flow
* **Processes:** photosynthesis, condensation, decomposition, fire



#### Draw Your Diagram

Diagramming is a useful tool for developing an understanding of Earth as a system. Making a diagram will help you focus on the most important components, connections, and systems at your study site, that may be different from other study sites. Keep in mind that there is no one right way to make a diagram. Your style of diagramming may be very different from someone else's. What matters is that it is accurate and complete, and that it clearly communicates your ideas. Other students must be able to understand your ideas just by looking at your diagram.  
  
Starting with the photograph you annotated in Part A, work with a partner or in a small group to create a simplified, more abstract diagram of your study site, showing how energy and matter flow between components. Be aware that as you put together this simplified diagram, you will need to make decisions about what is most important to show. This means that you are making decisions about what the essential reservoirs, fluxes, and processes at your study site are.

1. On a blank sheet of paper, draw and label the four major components of the study site system \(atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere\).
2. Use arrows to represent the verbs you used in your annotated photograph. Draw one-headed arrows to indicate which direction each interaction is occurring. Show only one direction on each arrow.
3. On the shaft of the arrow, indicate what is moving from one component to the other \(such as rain moving from the atmosphere to the pedosphere\).

#### Share Your Diagram

1. Share your diagram with the rest of the class. As other groups present their diagrams, look for ways their diagrams are similar to or different from your group's diagram.
2. Ask questions and provide constructive feedback on your classmates' diagrams. What was communicated clearly? What could be improved on? 
3. As a class, make a list of the most important features that should be included in a diagram of your local study site. Consider what people who are unfamiliar with the site would need to know to understand how the components of your study site are connected.
4. Have one person volunteer to draw a new class diagram that incorporates all of the important features from the list you made. The diagram should be drawn on poster-sized paper and hung up in the classroom, so you can refer to it \(and add on to it\) as you continue through the Earth System Science module.
