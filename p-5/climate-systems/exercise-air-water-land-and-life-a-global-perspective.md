# Exercise: Air, Water, Land, & Life- A Global Perspective

### Introduction

 If we were only able to observe the Earth from the ground, we would never be able to get a truly global view of the Earth system and the interactions among air, water, land, and life. The single best vantage point from which to learn the most about Earth, is from high above the surface. Fortunately, satellite technology has afforded us the ability to view Earth from the unique perspective of space.  
  
Satellites acquire new images of Earth all the time. Images from Earth-observing satellites show us enough of the Earth at once that we can see large-scale phenomena and interactions such as the spread of air pollution, damage from earthquakes, volcanoes, fires, or the entire span of a hurricane. Satellites can also track temporal changes to show things like deforestation, sea level rise, or ozone depletion. Observing Earth over time from space will enable us to evaluate the progression of climate change and the global impacts of human activity.  
  
In Part A of this lab, you will examine a variety of images and maps of the whole Earth in order to identify the major components of the Earth system at the global scale. In Part B, you will play a game that will help you better understand the water cycle and its importance within the Earth system. You will then describe the water cycle at the global scale in greater detail, identify the components through which water passes and the processes that move it, and draw an abstract diagram.  
  
After completing this investigation, you should be able to:

* use images and data about the whole Earth to identify the major components of the Earth system at the global scale;
* describe the pathway of water among the four components of the Earth system, as an example of ways they are interconnected; and
* translate your understanding of that pathway into an abstract diagram.

### Part A: Viewing Earth from Space

 Before satellites, remote sensing images were obtained in a variety of creative ways. Early remote sensing images in the mid to late 1800s were taken by hot-air balloonists. In 1897, Alfred Nobel \(for whom the Nobel prize is named\) took the first aerial photograph from aboard a rocket. In the early twentieth century, remote sensing images were even taken by cameras strapped to fleets of pigeons and kites. As technologies advanced throughout the 1900s, remote sensing via cameras aboard airplanes became valuable for things like wartime reconnaissance, urban development, disaster damage assessment, land use surveys, agricultural status, and oil exploration. But it wasn't until the latter half of the twentieth century, with the development of artificial satellites, that remote sensing expanded to the global scale. Today, more than a dozen NASA satellites keep constant watch over Earth.

#### NASA's Blue Marble

The full-Earth images below are the western- and eastern-hemisphere views of NASA's spectacular "blue marble" image of Earth. Scientists and visualizers created these true-color images by stitching together months of observations of the land surface, oceans, sea ice, and clouds into a seamless, true-color mosaic of every square kilometer \(0.386 square mile\) of our planet. [Click here](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/BlueMarble/BlueMarble_2002.php) to learn more about these images.

1. Carefully examine the "blue marble" images below.
2. Identify elements of the four major components of the Earth system \(atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, biosphere\).

#### NASA NEO

Earth system processes take place in and between the atmosphere, water, soil, and living components of the planet. These processes also include energy from the Sun, and the gases and particles that enter the atmosphere and oceans from both natural and anthropogenic \(human-related\), sources. The NASA Earth Observations \(NEO\) site is a great place to find imagery of NASA Earth science datasets. NEO has over 20 distinct energy, atmosphere, ocean, land, and life datasets, which are available as global snapshots in daily, weekly, and monthly time spans. In this part of the investigation, you will examine images of the Earth, looking for available information \(data displayed, unit of measure, range of values, etc.\) then for any noticeable patterns within the image.

1. Work in small groups to explore satellite images and data maps of the four components of the Earth system. Each group will explore at least one image from each category. Here are some suggested datasets for each group.  
  
   **Group 1—Energy**  
   Dataset Options:

   * Solar Insolation
   * Net Radiation

   **Group 2—Atmosphere**  
   Dataset Options:

   * Aerosol Optical Thickness
   * Cloud Fraction
   * Rainfall

   **Group 3—Ocean**  
   Dataset Options:

   * Sea Surface Temperature \(MODIS 2002+\)
   * Sea Ice and Snow Extent, Northern Hemisphere

   **Group 4—Land**  
   Dataset Options:

   * Land Surface Temperature \[Day\]
   * Land Surface Temperature \[Night\]
   * Land Cover Classification

   **Group 5—Life**  
   Dataset Options:

   * Vegetation Index
   * Population

2. Go to the [NASA Earth Observations \(NEO\) website](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The NEO Web site will open in a new browser window.
3. NEO organizes datasets into five categories: Ocean, Atmosphere, Energy, Land, and Life. Click on one of the buttons to see the list of available datasets for each category.
4. Select the dataset you want to display on the map. The display window loads the most recent map.
5. Carefully examine your map.
6. Find out about the dataset used to produce the map.
   * Scroll down to _**About this dataset**_  to learn more details about what your map is showing.
7. Explore your dataset in more detail using NEO's **Image Composite Explorer \(ICE\) Tool**.
8. Report back to the class!
