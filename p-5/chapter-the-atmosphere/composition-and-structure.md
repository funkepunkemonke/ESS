# COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE

The troposphere is composed of nitrogen \(78 percent\), oxygen \(21 percent\), argon \(less than 1 percent\), and a variety of other gases. There are a few outliers, which include ozone and methane. Ozone is primarily found in the stratosphere that creates the ozone layer. **Ozone** is also found near the Earth’s surface from photochemical smog, from the emission of vehicles. Significant methane sources include the digestion of food from cattle, fracking of natural gas, coal mines, and deforestation. Because these sources have geographic locations where they occur, consistent sources on Earth’s surface can be found.

**Greenhouse gases** are composed of carbon dioxide, water vapor, methane, and some other gasses in smaller quantities. These gasses are essential for scientists to monitor, analyze, and understand because of their ability to trap radiation in the lower atmosphere. The greenhouse effect’s strength and intensity will depend on the atmosphere’s temperature and the number of greenhouse gases that the atmosphere holds.

The term “greenhouse effect” is an incorrect description of how energy is retained within the troposphere. Greenhouses warm the atmosphere within them by reducing airflow and circulation, not by “trapping heat.” Nevertheless, the Earth’s natural greenhouse effect is critical to supporting life. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, have strengthened the natural greenhouse effect and causing the Earth’s atmosphere to warm over a noticeably short period.
