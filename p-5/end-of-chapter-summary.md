## Key Terms and Concepts

* Composition of the atmosphere
* Layers of the atmosphere: thermosphere, mesosphere, stratosphere, troposphere
* Electromagnetic radiation – types of radiation, radiation absorption/scatter/reflect
* Atmospheric pressure and density
* How rain forms: condensation nuclei and collision coalescence
* Mechanisms that form clouds: density, orographic, convergence, frontal
* How wind forms and moves
* Low pressure/High pressure systems
* Cold and warm fronts
* Air masses: tropical, marine, continental, polar, arctic
* Thunderstorms
* Tornadoes
* Hurricanes
* Global distribution of temperature, precipitation, and deserts

  Patterns of air movement and convection cells \(equator, 30°N/S, 60°N/S, poles\)

* Records of climate change: weather records, cultural records, tree rings, lake sediments, ice cores
* Natural causes of climate change: plate tectonics, ocean circulation, Milankovitch cycles
* Human-induced climate change: greenhouse gas emissions, greenhouse effects
  * Evidence: loss in Arctic sea ice, air temperature data, ocean temperature data, changes in weather patterns, changes in atmospheric concentration of gases
