# Introduction to Earth Systems Science

> “It is hard to imagine a more important discipline than Earth System Science” – John Lawton in Science magazine, June 15, 2001

Earth Systems Science is the study of the complex interrelationships between materials and energy in the atmosphere and in the solid, fluid, and living Earth. Systems Science also involves the study of human interactions with these natural systems. In this course, we will investigate the fundamental processes that drive these systems, focusing on the measurement and representation, and response to change over time. These topics will be presented within the context of a global perspective. During the course we will solve quantitative problems and use mathematical models to describe and assess the impact of humans on Earth's systems.

In the lab, we will have an opportunity to observe, measure, and model these systems. The lab activities will be presented in the framework of problems to be solved, and will involve critical thinking in addition to using the language of mathematics. 

### Course Description

This course provides a holistic view of Earth and the spatial relationships among its systems, or 'spheres' – atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. We will explore the fundamental scientific principles of Earth as a system and discuss human-earth interactions. Major topics that we will cover include solar energy, atmospheric composition and circulation, water resources, global climate, Earth materials, and the changing landscape.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:   
• _Describe_ the relationships between the sun and the Earth, and among Earth's four systems - the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere.  
• _Explain_ processes that shape the landscape, including weathering and plate tectonics.   
• _Identify_ and discuss Earth materials, including rocks and minerals.   
• _Illustrate_ the global cycling of water and its role in heat transfer.   
• _Discuss_ differences between weather patterns and climate.
