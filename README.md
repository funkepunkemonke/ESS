# Introduction to Earth Systems Science

> “It is hard to imagine a more important discipline than Earth System Science” – John Lawton in Science magazine, June 15, 2001

Earth Systems Science is the study of the complex interrelationships between materials and energy in the atmosphere and in the solid, fluid, and living Earth. Systems Science also involves the study of human interactions with these natural systems. In this course, we will investigate the fundamental processes that drive these systems, focusing on the measurement and representation, and response to change over time. These topics will be presented within the context of a global perspective. During the course we will solve quantitative problems and use mathematical models to describe and assess the impact of humans on Earth's systems.

In the lab, we will have an opportunity to observe, measure, and model these systems. The lab activities will be presented in the framework of problems to be solved, and will involve critical thinking in addition to using the language of mathematics.

### Course Description

This course introduces the structure and function of the earth system, with a focus on how the Earth system sustains life. Topics include \(1\) connections among terrestrial surface, oceans, and atmosphere and \(2\) how these connections create and sustain climates, biomes, and ecosystem services. 



### Learning Objectives

* To become familiar with the basic scientific underpinnings of earth system science.
* To practice working in teams on scientific topics.
* To help you become informed global citizens.
* To motivate you to continue to educate yourself and others on global environmental change outside the class.
