# Exercise: A Bird's Eye View of Your Region

### Introduction

The place where you live and go to school is different in many ways from everywhere else. It has a special combination of characteristics such as climate, kinds of living things, soils, bodies of water \(streams, rivers, lakes, etc.\), and land cover; elevation, and latitude and longitude. As you travel farther away from your school or study site, geographic features will start to look different. If you could look down at your study site from far above, you would see that your school and local study site are part of a larger region.

In Part A of this activity, you will look at diagrams and descriptions of study sites from other regions, and compare them with your own. In Part B, you will use Google Earth to explore and define a region around your local study site. Finally, in Part C, you will consider the inputs and outputs of your region and predict how changes in those inputs and outputs might affect other components of the Earth system.

After completing this investigation, you should be able to:

* compare and contrast local study sites in different regions;
* identify a region for study as an Earth system by finding boundaries;
* describe the region's boundaries so that others can find them on a map;
* identify some scientifically appropriate inputs and outputs of a system at the regional scale;
* predict how changes in the input or output of one component of a system might affect other components, reflecting the concept that parts of a system shape each other through their interactions.

### Part A: Comparing Your Study Site to One in Another Region

The basic components and interconnections among them are the same at nearly all local study sites: water, chemicals \(such as carbon\), and energy \(such as heat\) move among the four major components of the system \(atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere\). However, the _amounts_ of water, chemicals, and energy in each component of the system, and the _rate_ at which they move between the different components vary _a lot_ among different regions of the Earth. Therefore, diagrams of different sites may emphasize different components and interconnections.  
  
One example of differences might be seen in diagrams of study sites in dry vs. wet regions. In a dry region where it may rain only one season of the year, students might emphasize erosion by wind and water in their diagrams. However, in a wet region where it rains or snows throughout the year, the students might emphasize more of the water cycle, showing evaporation, cloud cover and precipitation in their diagrams.  
  
Another example of differences might be seen in diagrams of study sites in a tropical rain forest vs. a temperate forest. Students diagramming a rain forest site may emphasize the plants and their role as a storage place for nutrients, whereas students diagramming a temperate forest may emphasize the soil as a storage place for nutrients.

2. Working with a partner or small group, look for similarities and differences between your class study site diagram to one of the four sample study site diagrams.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Stop and Think

Look at both the sample study site diagram and your own class diagram. Compare the components and interconnections among those components that appear in each diagram.

*  Does the sample study site diagram emphasize aspects of the study site that are different from the aspects emphasized in your diagram? Which aspects?
* Why does your diagram emphasize different interconnections and components of the Earth system than the example study site diagram? Explain.

### Part B: Defining Your Region

Your local study site is just one small piece of the entire Earth system. It's a great place to study details up close, but it's too small an area to give you a thorough understanding of the bigger picture. Before you start to think about the Earth as a whole, consider the _region_ surrounding your local study site. A region is larger in scale than your local study site and is generally characterized by some common feature or features that differentiate it from neighboring areas. Regional boundaries are where those features or characteristics change. Regions can be defined in different ways. They can have natural boundaries, human-made boundaries, or political/social boundaries. Here are some examples of regions with different types of boundaries:  
  
**Natural Boundaries**

* a watershed \(area of land where all of the water that is under it or drains off of it, goes into the same place\)
* a mountain range
* a river basin
* a desert
* a plain
* a peninsula

  
**Human-made Boundaries**

* a watershed in which a boundary is a dam
* an area larger than a local study site bounded by highways, railroads, and bridges
* a natural area surrounded by populated regions or a populated region surrounded by a natural area
* a park or game preserve

  
**Political/Social Boundaries**

* a state or province
* a country

Google Earth is a virtual globe program that displays satellite images of Earth's surface, allowing you to see things like countries, cities, and even houses from a bird's-eye view. It's a great tool for expanding your view of the world and gaining some perspective on the relative size and scale of Earth's features.

1. Install Google Earth. **NOTE:** If you already have Google Earth installed on your computer, skip to Step 2.  


   * Go to the [Google Earth download site](https://earth.google.com/download-earth.html) to download and install the free version of Google Earth for your operating system.

2. Adjust your latitude/longitude setting to decimal degrees.  


   * Choose **Tools &gt; Options**\(PC\) or **Google Earth &gt; Preferences...**\(Mac\)
   * In the **Preferences** window, choose **Decimal Degrees** for the Show Lat/Long option.

3. Fly to your local study site location.  


   * Type the address or latitude/longitude coordinates for your local study site in the **Search** box and click the**Search** button. **NOTE:** For best results, type in addresses just like you would address a letter. Use spaces instead of returns between the street address and the city, state, and zip code. Capitalization and punctuation don't matter much, but spelling counts. It's particularly important to include the state or zip code, since cities with the same name can be found in many states.
   * Google Earth should zoom into your study site. Depending on your Internet connection, there may be a delay as the high-resolution images load.

4. Mark the location of your study site with a placemark. 
   * Click the **Add Placemark** button [![ge\_add\_placemark](https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/eyesinthesky2/week9/ge_add_placemark_20.jpg) ](https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/images/eyesinthesky2/week9/ge_add_placemark.jpg)and a **New Placemark** window opens.
   * In the **New Placemark** window, click the pushpin icon in the upper right corner. This opens an **Icon** window. Click on an icon to choose it. Then **OK**.
   * In the **New Placemark** window, enter a description and give the placemark a name. Click **OK** to create the placemark which now shows up in the 3D Viewer.
   * Click the placemark icon in the 3D Viewer to open the description balloon. If the description balloon covers up too much of the view, zoom out just a bit more so you can see the context of the scene. 
5. Zoom out using one of the following methods. **NOTE:** If you zoom out too far and need to zoom back in, just do the opposite of what you did to zoom out. 
   * If your mouse has a scroll wheel or trackball: move your mouse over the map and roll the wheel or ball DOWN \(toward yourself\).
   * If you don't have a scroll wheel: move your mouse over the map, right-click \(CTRL + click on a Mac\), and move your mouse DOWN \(toward yourself\).
   * Use the navigation controls: The navigation controls are in the top right corner of the **3D Viewer** window. They offer the same navigation actions as mouse navigation, plus some additional features. The navigation controls disappear when you aren't using them, but re-appear when you move your mouse over them. To zoom out, click and hold the **Zoom Out** button \(at the bottom of the **Zoom Slider**\) to zoom out.
6. Look for boundaries to define your region. Here are some things you might consider using as boundaries:
   * bodies of water such as streams, canals, rivers, ponds, lakes, or an ocean
   * topographic features such as mountains, plateaus, or valleys
   * vegetation types such as forest, meadow, wetland, or desert
   * roads, bridges, and other areas of human development \(homes, off√Øce buildings, factories, and shopping centers\)
   * political boundaries such as county or state lines
   * parks

{% hint style="info" %}
### Stop and Think

* What features or characteristics are you using to identify your region? Why?
* How will you describe your region to the class? List the geographic landmarks that will help you identify the full circumference of the region's boundaries ‚Äî north, south, east, and west. You can use latitude and longitude lines, if necessary.
{% endhint %}



1. Share your choice of region with the rest of the class \(print out an image if necessary\). Explain to your classmates how you chose your regional boundaries. 
2. As a class, discuss the merits of the different regional boundaries each group selected. Come to a consensus about the region you will use to study as a system.

### Part C: Exploring Regional Inputs and Outputs

When studying a system, it is important to think about the interactions among the components within the system. It is also important to consider the inputs and outputs of the system. _What, if anything, enters the system? What, if anything, leaves?_ The inputs and outputs will help you understand how the system you are studying changes over time.  
  
There are three types of systems: open, closed, and isolated. An _open system_ continuously interacts with its environment. Energy and/or matter flows freely across the system's boundaries. A _closed system_ is one in which no matter enters or leaves. An _isolated system_ exchanges absolutely no energy, matter, or information across its boundaries.

1. Imagine a box around the region you defined in Part B. This imaginary box should include not only the surface of the Earth, but also what is above \(atmosphere\) and what is below the surface \(pedosphere or soil\). 
2. With a partner or small group, make a list of the inputs and outputs of your region. Think about what you already know about the water cycle, the energy cycle, and the chemical cycle and how it can be applied to the inputs and outputs of your regional system. Consider all four components of the Earth system and the processes that connect them.

   * Atmosphere: air, clouds, and precipitation \(rain, snow, hail\)
   * Hydrosphere: water in streams, canals, rivers, ponds, lakes, and oceans; also ground water
   * Pedosphere: soil
   * Biosphere: living things
   * Cycling of water, chemicals, and energy

   As you make your list, think about the following questions: _What is carried by water? What is carried by air? What moves through the ground? What do animals carry? What do people carry?_  

3. Share your list with the rest of the class. Together, compile a class list of inputs and outputs for your region. 
4. On your own or with your partner/small group, answer the **Stop and Think** questions.

{% hint style="info" %}
### Stop and Think

* Write three "what-if" questions about changes to specific inputs and outputs of the region. For each of those what-if questions, make a prediction. How will that change affect the other components \(atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere\) of the region?
* Do you think your region is an open, closed, or isolated system? Explain.



**Example**: Question: What if the stream coming through the region was dammed up before the water entered the region? Prediction: The plants in the region would die and the animals would leave due to lack of water. \(biosphere\) The region would be drier because there would be less water both in the soil and atmosphere. \(pedosphere, atmosphere\) The stream bed would dry up and the fish would die. \(hydrosphere, biosphere\)

**Tips**

* Make sure your questions and predictions deal with only one change to the system at a time.
* Write your predictions in terms of the four major components of the Earth system. For example, _How might the change affect the atmosphere? How might it affect the biosphere \(living things\)?_
* Be prepared to defend any predictions you make on the basis of scientific knowledge.
