# Chapter 3: The Tectonic Cycle

Mountains such as the Alps or Appalachians that seem changeless to us are only transient wrinkles when viewed from the perspective of geologic time. Mountain ranges grow when fragments of moving lithosphere collide, heaving masses of twisted and deformed rock upward. Then the mountains are slowly worn away, leaving only the eroded roots of an old mountain range to record the ancient collision. The continents are slowly moving, sometimes bumping into each other and creating a new mountain range, sometimes splitting apart so that a new ocean basin forms. 

These processes have gone on through much of Earth’s 4.56-billion-year history, and they continue today. For example, the Himalaya is a range of geologically young mountains that began to form when the Indian subcontinent collided with Asia about 45 million years ago; these mountains are still being uplifted today . The Red Sea is a young ocean that started forming about 30 million years ago when a split developed between the Arabian Peninsula and Africa as the two landmasses began to move apart; this new ocean is still widening today. Clearly these great forces that operate within the geosphere—the solid Earth—are responsible for shaping Earth’s surface. What is the origin of these forces? What drives them? Have they operated throughout Earth history? In what ways do these processes influence the rest of the Earth system? Is the geosphere actually solid, or is it more complex than it appears on the surface?

THE LITHOSPHERE—EARTH’S STRONG, rigid outer shell of rock—is broken into about a dozen plates, which slide past, converge with, or separate from each other as they move over the weaker, ductile asthenosphere. Plates are formed where they separate and recycled where they converge in a continuous process of creation and destruction. Continents, embedded in the lithosphere, drift along with the moving plates. 

The theory of plate tectonics describes the movements of plates and the forces acting on them. It also explains volcanoes, earthquakes, and the distribution of mountain chains, rock assemblages, and structures on the seafloor—all of which result from events at plate boundaries. Plate tectonics provides a conceptual framework for a large part of this textbook and, indeed, for much of geology. 

This chapter lays out the theory of plate tectonics and how it was discovered, describes plate movements today and in the geologic past, and examines how the forces that drive these movements arise from the mantle convection system.
