# Mantle Convection: The Engine of Plate Tectonics

Just as Wegener felt sure that continents had drifted but could not explain how, today we are sure that plates move and that convection currents in the mantle play a role in that movement, but we are still unable to say precisely what role. The situation is analogous to recognizing the shape, color, size, and speed capability of an automobile and knowing that gasoline supplies the energy needed for movement, but not knowing exactly how the gasoline makes the engine work. Until the driving mechanism is explained, plate tectonics must remain only an approximate description. Meanwhile, we can hypothesize about the causes of the motion and test the hypotheses by making detailed calculations based on the laws of nature. 

We know that the lithosphere is cold, hard, and brittle, and that the underlying asthenosphere is hotter and more mobile. We also know that the lithosphere and the asthenosphere are closely bound together. If the asthenosphere moves, the lithosphere must move too, just as the movement of a sticky molasses or tar will move a piece of wood floating on its surface. Conversely, movement of the lithosphere causes movement in the asthenosphere. Scientists cannot yet separate the relative importance of the two effects; however, on two points they are quite certain: \(1\) the lithosphere has energy of motion, and \(2\) the source of this energy is Earth’s internal heat, which reaches the base of the lithosphere by convection in the mantle. What has not yet been figured out is the precise way the heat energy brought up by convection causes the plates to move.

Three forces might play a role in moving the brittle slabs of lithosphere. The first is that rising magma and the formation of new oceanic crust at a spreading ridge may be pushing the plates away from each other. A second way the lithosphere could be made to move is by dragging. Lithosphere that breaks and starts to sink through the asthenosphere is cold, and therefore denser than the hot asthenosphere through which it is sinking. The sinking fragment of lithosphere may act like a heavy weight, pulling or dragging the entire plate downward. third possible mechanism is for the whole plate to be sliding downhill away from the spreading ridge. The lithosphere is thinnest near a spreading ridge, where hot magma is rising from the mantle, and grows cooler and thicker away from the ridge. Consequently, the boundary between the lithosphere and the underlying asthenosphere slopes away from the ridge. Even if the slope is extremely gentle, the lithosphere’s own weight could cause it to slide at a rate of several centimeters per year.

All of these proposed mechanisms have pros and cons. At present, there is no way to choose among them. Calculations suggest that each of them operates to some extent, so that the entire process is possibly more complicated than we now imagine. The prevailing hypothesis is that old, cold lithosphere breaks and begins to sink, pulling downward on the plate. Once this movement starts, downhill slide and ridge push combine to keep the process going.

In addition to the discussion about convection as a driving force for plate motion, there is ongoing scientific debate about the exact configuration of convection cells in the mantle. Some scientists believe that convection occurs in the whole mantle, stretching all the way from the core-mantle boundary to the base of the lithosphere. However, we know from seismic studies and computer modeling that the asthenosphere is not the only layer present within the mantle; there are additional layers with differing properties in deeper parts of the mantle. Perhaps this layering indicates that the upper part of the mantle is convecting separately from the lower part of the mantle. Hopefully, future research will resolve these questions about mantle convection and its relationship to plate motion.

![The results of computer models of the mantle, like the one shown here, have revealed much useful information about heat flow and convection in the mantle. Here, the colors show the relative temperatures of mantle rocks, with red indicating higher temperatures and blue indicating cooler temperatures. This model shows whole-mantle convection, but other models suggest that the mantle may be convecting in layers.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2841%29.png)
