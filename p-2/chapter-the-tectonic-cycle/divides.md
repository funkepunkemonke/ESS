 A **divide** is a topographically high area that separates a landscape into different water basins. Rain that falls on the north side of a ridge flows into the northern drainage basin and rain that falls on the south side flows into the southern drainage basin. On a much grander scale, entire continents have divides, known as continental divides. 

In North America, continental divides lie at the head of major streams that drain into the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. In South America, a single continental divide extends along the crest of the Andes and divides the continent into two regions of unequal size. Streams draining the western \(Pacific\) slope of the Andes are steep and short, whereas to the east the streams take much longer routes along more gentle gradients to reach the Atlantic shore. 

Because continental divides often coincide with the crests of mountain ranges, and because mountain ranges are the result of tectonic uplift, a **close relationship must exist between plate tectonics and the locations of stream divides and drainage basins.** The location of a divide plays an important role in determining the climate of a region, but—perhaps surprisingly—climate, in turn, can influence the location of the divide and the evolution of the landscape itself. When a divide lies close to a continental margin, there is typically a strong climatic gradient across it. An unequal distribution of precipitation can lead to a marked landscape asymmetry across the divide. Streams draining the windward \(wet\) side commonly have steeper gradients than those draining the lee \(dry\) side, and erosion rates are higher. Over time, the net effect will be the headward growth of channels on the wet side, causing the divide itself to slowly shift toward the drier side.

A striking example of a shifting divide can be seen in the Andes of southern South America. Through nearly 60 degrees of latitude, from the northern tip of the continent to well south of Santiago, Chile, the drainage divide coincides with the topographic crest of the Andes. However, south of 45°, where easterly winds give way to westerlies flowing off the Pacific, the continental divide has shifted eastward in several locations. During glaciations, the mountain ice cap of the southern Andes apparently was thickest over the fjord region of southern Chile, which received heavy snowfall from the moist westerly winds flowing onshore. Outlet glaciers of a large ice cap flowed eastward across saddles in the main Andean crest, progressively deepening and ultimately eliminating these topographic barriers. In several sectors, the continental divide between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans now lies along the crest of the moraines—glacial deposits that mark the limits of the glaciers that terminated near or beyond the eastern front of the mountains.
