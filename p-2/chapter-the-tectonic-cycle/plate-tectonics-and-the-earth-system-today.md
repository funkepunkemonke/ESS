# Plate Tectonics And The Earth System Today

Almost every part of the Earth system is influenced directly or indirectly by plate tectonics driven by Earth’s internal heat source. To complete our discussion of plate tectonics, let’s consider some examples of such influences.

### Composition of Ocean Water

 The great chain of submarine volcanoes along the midocean ridges is the site of intense chemical reaction between the waters of the ocean and the hot rocks of the seafloor. Some chemical elements are extracted from seawater into the rocks, and others are released from the rocks into the seawater. In this manner the hot rocks of the oceanic crust play an important role in determining the composition of seawater. 

### Composition of the Atmosphere 

Volcanoes, both along plate spreading edges and adjacent to subduction zones, release vast amounts of gas into the atmosphere. Earth’s primordial envelope of gases was stripped away, early in the history of our solar system. Without the release of volcanic gases over geologic time, Earth would not have evolved the secondary atmosphere that supports life on the planet today. The vigor of volcanic activity is one of the fundamental controls on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and hence on the global climate. During periods of Earth history when volcanic activity has been at a minimum, atmospheric greenhouse gases are correspondingly low and the resulting global climate is cool; these are referred to as icehouse periods. Conversely, when volcanic activity is particularly vigorous, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations increase and the global climate is consequently warmer; these are known as hothouse periods. Volcanic gases continue to play an important role in the climate and the long-term composition of the atmosphere. Very large eruptions can also cause dramatic short-term, irregular climatic disturbances. 

### Sequestration of Carbon 

Sediment that is formed as a result of processes in the rock cycle accumulates in the low-lying ocean basins, where it is converted to rock. Such sediments and sedimentary rocks are the most important places in which carbon-rich organic matter is sequestered. Carbon sequestration is one of the most fundamentally important processes on Earth. Without such sequestering the atmosphere would be essentially devoid of oxygen but rich in carbon dioxide, like the atmosphere of Venus. Such an Earth would not be habitable. Even the rate of opening and closing ocean basins is important in this context. The repositioning of the continents and ocean basins influences everything from sea level to the rates of weathering, erosion, and sedimentation; these, in turn, influence the rate of carbon sequestration and hence the global climate. In all of these ways, and many others, plate tectonics has influenced virtually every part of the Earth system over the history of this planet, and it continues to do so today. Without plate tectonics, the surface of Earth would be still and lifeless, like the surface of Mercury.
