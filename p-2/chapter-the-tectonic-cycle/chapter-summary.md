# Chapter Summary

Plate tectonics is a unifying theory that explains Earth’s topography and integrates our scientific understanding of rock formation, mountain building, and terrain modification. Early proponents of continental drift amassed an impressive body of evidence that the continents had once been joined; however, most scientists remained skeptical until other sources provided solid evidence for the mechanisms and a driving force behind continental movement.

**What is the theory of plate tectonics?** For over the last century some geologists have argued for the concept of continental drift because of the jigsaw-puzzle fit of the coasts on both sides of the Atlantic, the geological similarities in rock ages and trends in geologic structures on opposite sides of the Atlantic, fossil evidence suggesting that continents were joined at one time, and the distribution of glacial deposits as well as other paleoclimatic evidence.

**What are some of the geologic characteristics of plate boundaries?** There are three major types of boundaries between lithospheric plates: divergent boundaries, where plates move apart; convergent boundaries, where plates move together and one plate often subducts beneath the other; and transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other. Volcanoes, earthquakes and mountains are concentrated along the active plate boundaries. Mountains typically form along convergent and transform plate boundaries. Where divergent plate boundaries are exposed on land, subsiding basins and volcanism are typical.

**How can the age of the seafloor be determined?** The age and relative plate velocity are inferred from changes in the paleomagnetic properties of the ocean floor.

**How is the history of plate movement reconstructed?** Seafloor isochrons provide the basis for reconstructing plate motions for about the last 200 million years. Distinct assemblages of rocks characterize each type of plate boundary. Using diagnostic rock assemblages embedded in continents and paleoenvironmental data recorded by fossils and sedimentary rocks, geologists have been able to reconstruct ancient plate tectonic events and plate configurations.

**What is the engine that drives plate tectonics?** Driven by Earth’s internal heat, convection within the mantle, coupled with the force of gravity and the existence of a soft zone, called the asthenosphere, are important factors in models for how plate tectonics works.
