## Summary

**Why does volcanism occur?** • Volcanism occurs when molten rock inside the Earth rises buoyantly to the surface because it is less dense than the surrounding rock. Volcanism is a surface expression of magma generation within the Earth.

**What are the three major lava types and how do they relate to eruptive style and volcanic landforms?** • Silicate lavas can be classified in three major types—felsic \(rhyolite\), intermediate \(andesite\), and mafic \(basalt\)—based on decreasing amount of silica and increasing amounts of iron and magnesium. • Eruption styles, volcanic deposits, landforms, and potential hazards are strongly linked to the chemical composition and gas content of the lava \(refer to Exercise 1\). Because basaltic lavas are relatively fluid and dry, they typically exhibit less explosive eruptions and erupt as lava flows. Rhyolite lavas are very viscous and usually wet. Therefore, they typically erupt very explosively as pyroclastic flows or form domes. 

**How is volcanism related to plate tectonics? •** There is a strong connection between major types of volcanism and crustal plate boundaries. Basaltic lavas occur at divergent plate boundaries and hot spots. The ocean crust is created by basaltic volcanism at the ocean ridge system. Basalt is thought to be generated by partial melting due to decompression of the ultramafic upper mantle. Basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic lavas erupt at convergent zones due to fluid-induced melting. The lavas generated along any particular convergent zone depend in large part on what type of rocks are being subducted and melted within the overriding crust. 

**How does volcanism interact with human affairs?** • There are both benefits and hazards associated with volcanism. Geothermal heat is growing in importance for electric energy generation. Earth’s oceans and atmosphere are thought to have condensed from volcanic degassing of our planet’s interior. Volcanic dust and gases can impact global climate. Volcanic eruptions and associated mudflows can have disastrous impacts on a region and its people. Important ore-forming processes occur when hot water circulates through the magma chamber and surrounding rock.

**What is an earthquake?** • An earthquake is a shaking of the ground caused by seismic waves that emanate from a fault that moves suddenly. When the fault moves, the strain built up over years of slow deformation by tectonic forces is released in a few minutes as seismic waves. • Elastic rebound theory explains why earthquakes occur. Over a period of time, the application of stress causes rock to slowly deform \(bend\) elastically until it breaks, and the rock snaps back as the fault moves. This stretching and breaking is analogous to stretching a rubber band until it breaks and snaps back to sting your hand. 

**What determines the depth of an earthquake?** • The focus is a point along the fault at which the earthquake initiates. • Earthquakes occur only in brittle rock, which can break and snap back elastically. At high temperatures and confining pressures found at greater depths, rocks are ductile and do not break to generate earthquakes. • Earthquakes occur within cold, brittle subducting oceanic lithosphere to a depth of about 700 km. Below this depth, the rock is too hot and soft to break.

**Where do most earthquakes occur?** • Most but not all earthquakes occur along crust plate boundaries. Earthquakes at divergent plate boundaries are usually shallow, have lower magnitude, and are a consequence of tensional stress. Convergent plate boundaries produce shallow and deep earthquakes of low to high magnitudes and are commonly caused by compressive stress. Transform faults produce shallow to moderately deep earthquakes of low to high magnitude, usually in response to shear stress.



## Thought Questions

1. Describe how Alfred Wegener determined that all continents were once connected in the single land mass he called Pangaea.
2. Compare and contrast the different types of plate boundaries. What features are similar among all types of plate boundaries and what features are unique to specific types of plate boundaries? 
3. How do plate boundaries shape the landscape \(i.e. what features on Earth’s surface might indicate the presence of a plate boundary\)?
4. Earthquakes occur due to plate tectonics and the seismic waves produced by an earthquake follow a very specific pattern. What is the pattern that seismic waves follow and how does each type of seismic wave affect a structure such as a skyscraper?
5. Describe the differences among shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and cinder cones. How can you explain these differences by the composition of their lavas and other factors?
