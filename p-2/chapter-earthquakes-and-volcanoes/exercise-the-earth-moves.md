# Exercise: THE EARTH MOVES

## 

## Where are global earthquakes located?

**Step 1:** Go to the ArcGIS Online map, [Earth Moves](https://education.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=f21eadbc34ee4ff4ad41ee6d69f9f4b3), and explore the map.

**Step 2:** Examine the yellow dots on the map that represent earthquakes with a +5.7 magnitude.

**Geographic Question**

* What spatial patterns do you see on the map?

## Where are the most significant earthquakes on Earth?

**Step 3:** With the Details button depressed, click the button, Show Contents.

**Step 4:** Click the Earthquakes Magnitude 5.7+ layer name, and then click the Show Table button.

Each record in this attribute table represents one point on the map.

**Step 5:** Click the Magnitude column heading \(field\) and choose Sort Descending.

**Step 6:** Highlight the first 20 records \(highest magnitude earthquakes\). In the table, click a feature in the list to see it highlighted in the map. To select multiple features, press the Shift key and click each feature that you want to highlight.

**Geographic Question**

* Where are the blue highlighted high-magnitude earthquakes located on the map?

## Where are the active volcanoes on Earth?

**Step 7:** In the top-right corner of the table, click the X to close the table.

**Step 8:** In the Contents pane, uncheck the Earthquakes Magnitude 5.7+ layer box to turn off the layer and turn on the Volcanoes – Active Only layer.

**Geographic Question**

* The observable spatial patterns are that earthquake and volcano locations line up in similar patterns except for the volcanoes in some areas of Africa and the north Pacific Ocean. \(T/F\)

## Where are tectonic plates relative to physical features on Earth?

* Based on the locations of earthquakes and volcanoes, where do you think the tectonic plate boundaries are?

Earth is always changing. The crust of the earth includes several tectonic plates that are always on the move. The effects of movement are most noticeable at the boundaries between tectonic plates.

**Step 9:** Turn off the Volcanoes – Active Only layer and turn on the Earth’s Tectonic Plates and Major Physical Features layers.

**Geographic Question**

* There are many tectonic areas where physical features, tectonic plate boundaries, and seismic and volcanic activities overlap. They include the eastern part of the map where the Philippine and Pacific tectonic plates meet, eastern Africa, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the western coast of North and South America. NOTE: Turn on earthquakes and volcanoes if needed. \(T/F\) 

## Where might there be higher-risk areas for seismic or volcanic activity?

**Step 10:** Turn off all layers except Major Cities, Continents, Earthquakes, and Volcanoes – Active Only.

**Step 11:** Pan and zoom the map to find cities near an earthquake or volcano.

**Geographic Question**

* Name three cities and the area in which they are located.

## Is the earth’s crust thick or thin?

**Step 12**: Go to the ArcGIS Online map, [Plate Type Effect on Volcanoes](http://education.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=140510ed00944ad596b8ebfde48c8a56), and explore the map.

**Step 13**: Click the pin on the Pacific Coast.

**Step 14**: Click the image in the pop-up to see more detail.

**Geographic Questions**

* What is this ocean’s average depth?
* What is the continent’s average elevation?

On the map, it appears that there are generally two types of the earth’s crust. That is because there is the oceanic crust and continental crust. Oceanic crust is thinner, but denser than continental crust. Continental crust is thicker, but less dense. So when the two collide, the heavier, oceanic crust subducts below the continental crust.

## How else are the earth’s crust’s different?

Volcanoes form when melted crust \(magma\) cools at the surface \(lava\). Stickier, viscous, or slower-flowing lave piles up steeply before solidifying. More easily flowing, less viscous lava spreads out broadly before cooling.

**Step 15**: Click the button, Bookmarks, and select Mount Rainier. Click the arrow icon.

Mount Rainier’s shape implies that the magma has a high viscosity \(thick\), which causes the volcano to grow high with a steep peak. If the magma were less viscous \(thinner\), the volcano would have shallow slopes.

**Geographic Question**

* The oceanic crust consists of different denser material than continental crust, which sinks deeper into the Earth’s crust. \(T/F\)

**Step 16**: Click the button, Bookmarks, and select Mauna Loa. Next, click the arrow.

**Geographic Question**

* What does the volcano’s shape imply about the viscosity of the lava?



## How are other sticky solutions like lava?

Think of lava-like a sugar solution. Higher sugar content is more viscous and flows slowly. Consider an analogy between the shape of a freshly poured puddle of juice compared to a puddle of syrup or honey. Juice is thin, and runny, making a broad puddle. The syrup is thicker and makes a small peak where poured. Honey is thickest, with a steeper, higher peak when first poured. In a volcano, the amount of silicate acts like a sugar in solution. Ocean plates have little silicate, while continental crust is rich in silicate. Like honey, continental volcanoes are steeper and more localized.

## Does each tectonic plate type create its own distinct pattern of volcanoes?

**Step 17**: Click the Default Extent button \(between the Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons, the upper-left corner of the map.

**Step 18**: With the Details button underlined, click the button, Show Contents of Map \(Content\).

**Step 19**: Turn on the two layers, Plate Boundaries and Global Volcanoes.

**Step 20**: Click different tectonic plate boundaries to see a summary of graphs of the types of volcanoes that occur within 250 miles.

**Geographic Questions**

* Which boundary type has the most volcanoes?
* Which has the highest percentage of shield volcanoes \(the portion in white\)?
* Which boundary type has a higher percentage of cinder cone formation?

## Why do many oceans have their ridges?

**Geographic Question**

* Volcanoes that form along convergent boundaries form off to one side of a tectonic boundary. The crust on the other side of the boundary must run deep enough under a volcano’s tectonic plate to melt. \(Zoom in for more detail.\)

**Step 21**: Pan and zoom to a divergent boundary \(e.g., Chile or Aleutian Islands\).

**Geographic Question**

* Volcanoes along divergent boundaries occur directly over rising hot convection currents from the earth’s core, melting the crust into volcanoes \(points\) and fissures \(longer lines\). \(T/F\)
* When a continent is over a divergent boundary, it has the potential to split the continent, and after enough time, could create a sea or ocean. \(T/F\)
