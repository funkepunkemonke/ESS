## Thought Questions

1. Describe how Alfred Wegener determined that all continents were once connected in the single land mass he called Pangaea.
2. Compare and contrast the different types of plate boundaries. What features are similar among all types of plate boundaries and what features are unique to specific types of plate boundaries? 
3. How do plate boundaries shape the landscape \(i.e. what features on Earthâ€™s surface might indicate the presence of a plate boundary\)?
4. Earthquakes occur due to plate tectonics and the seismic waves produced by an earthquake follow a very specific pattern. What is the pattern that seismic waves follow and how does each type of seismic wave affect a structure such as a skyscraper?
5. Describe the differences among shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, and cinder cones. How can you explain these differences by the composition of their lavas and other factors?
