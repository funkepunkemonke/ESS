**Step 1**: Go to the ArcGIS Online map, [Mining the World’s Most Used Minerals](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=f728abfbfaff439dbc155a39ac27988e), and explore the map.

**Step 2**: Click Modify Map, and then click the Contents button.

**Step 3**: Click the Bingham Canyon Mine bookmark to zoom to the most significant and deepest open-pit mine in the world.

**Step 4**: Measure the opening of the mine from the west rim to the east rim.

* How far is it across the opening?
* It is said that 9,000,000 people could fit into the Bingham Canyon Copper Mine. How many major league football stadiums would fit in this hole? \[Using the 80,000-person capacity of the Dallas Cowboys’ AT&T Stadium, approximately 115 stadiums would fit in the hole.

**Step 5**: Switch the basemap to Imagery

**Step 6:** Each mine is the largest of its kind in the world. Click the bookmarks for each mine, and then click each pushpin to view additional information.

* What does each mine produce?
* Based on the information you learned from the Bingham Canyon Mine, what is the total amount of mineral resources an average person uses?

**Step 7**: Change the basemap back to Topographic.

**Step 8**: Click the Home button to see the full extent of the map.

**Step 9**: Turn on the Copper Mine Density layer and the Sources of Minerals layer.

**Step 10**: Click the large box containing the word Copper to see how copper ore is formed.

* What are the top three areas that produce this metal for the world?

**Step 11**: Explore the other three metals \(iron, aluminum, and gold\) in the same way.Elaborate: At this rate, how long can we use resources?

**Step 12:** Click the pin next to Lake Huron.

**Step 13**: Click the image of the popup, and explore the image and graph further.

* Which resource will we run out of soonest if we keep consuming it at today’s rate?
* What product will we need to redesign after we run out of its associated mineral?
