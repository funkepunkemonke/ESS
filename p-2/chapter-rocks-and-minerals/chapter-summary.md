Differences Between the Three Rock Types

|  | Igneous | Sedimentary | Metamorphic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Source of materials | Melting of rocks in crust and mantle | Weathering and erosion of rocks exposed at the surface | High temperatures and pressures in deep crust and upper mantle, breaks from faulting or impact |
| Rock-forming process | Crystallization \(solidification of melt\) | Sedimentation, burial, and lithification \(compaction and cementation\) | Shearing and recrystallizing in the solid state |

**What are minerals?** • Minerals are naturally occurring inorganic solids with a specific crystal structure and chemical composition. 

**How do atoms combine to form the crystal structure of minerals? •** Minerals form when atoms or ions chemically bond in an orderly, threedimensional geometric array—a crystal structure. The character of the chemical bond can be ionic, covalent, or metallic. Ionic bonds are the dominant type of chemical bonds in mineral structures. 

**What is the atomic structure of minerals?** • The atomic structure is determined by how the atoms or ions pack together to form a crystalline solid. The packing of atoms depends on their size and the characteristics of chemical bonds between the atoms.

 **What are the major rock-forming minerals and what are their physical properties?** • The strength of the chemical bonds and the crystalline structure determines many of the physical properties of minerals, such as hardness and cleavage. • Silicate minerals are the most abundant class of minerals in the Earth’s crust and mantle. Isolated and chain silicates—olivine, pyroxene, and hornblende Sheet silicates—micas and clay minerals Framework silicates—feldspar and quartz • Other common mineral classes include carbonates, oxides, sulfates, sulfides, halides, and native metals.

**What determines the properties of rocks?** • The properties and names of rocks are determined by mineral content \(the kinds and proportions of minerals that make up rocks\) and texture \(the size, shapes, and spatial arrangement of a rock’s crystals or grains\).

**What are the three types of rocks, and how are they formed?** • There are three major rock types. Igneous rocks solidify from molten liquid \(magma\). Crystal size within igneous rocks is largely determined by the cooling rate of the magma body. Sedimentary rocks are made of sediments formed from the weathering and erosion of any preexisting rock. Deposition, burial, and lithification \(compaction and cementation\) transform loose sediments into sedimentary rocks. Metamorphic rocks are produced by alteration in the solid state of any preexisting rock by high pressures and temperatures, which result in a change in texture, mineral composition, or chemical composition.
