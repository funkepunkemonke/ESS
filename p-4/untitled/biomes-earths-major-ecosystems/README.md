# BIOMES: EARTH’S MAJOR ECOSYSTEMS

## Biogeography

The geographic distribution of living organisms and the characteristics of their communities and ecosystems are the central focus of biogeography. The most important unit of biogeography is the **biome**, a large geographic area defined by its environmental attributes—mainly temperature and precipitation—as well as by the plants, animals, and soils that inhabit and characterize the area. Biomes are Earth’s major ecosystem types. 

### Biomes and Ecozones

 A particular biome can have examples that occur in various geographic locations, with similar characteristics. For example, a desert is basically a desert. There are many variations and many deserts, but all deserts—wherever they occur—have certain characteristics in common. These include, notably, very low precipitation and \(therefore\) organisms that are adapted to dry conditions. For example, the Mohave Desert has low precipitation and dry soil; it features plants with waxy coatings and spines instead of leaves \(to minimize water loss through the broad, unprotected surfaces of leaves\). The Sahara and Gobi deserts have similar physical characteristics; they host plants that are unrelated to the plants of the Mohave Desert, but nevertheless share these dry environment adaptive characteristics. 

Different biomes that coexist in a particular geographic region constitute a bioregion or, on an even broader \(roughly continental\) geographic scale, an ecozone. A single ecozone thus includes several different biomes. Approximately eight ecozones constitute the biosphere, although different researchers categorize ecozones differently. 

These terms may seem confusing; exactly what is the difference between a biome and an ecozone? The biome concept acknowledges that ecosystems with similar characteristics, and similar flora and fauna, can evolve separately, in locations that are widely separated from one another geographically. Thus, for example, tropical rain forests with similar characteristics are found in many different locations, on different continents. 

The bioregion and ecozone concepts, on the other hand, acknowledge that ecosystems with different characteristics can share an evolutionary history because they coexist in a given geographic location or region. A tropical rain forest in Brazil may display similar characteristics to a tropical rain forest in Indonesia, but these rain forests—both of them exemplars of the tropical rain forest biome—do not share a common geographic location or evolutionary history, and therefore they belong to distinct ecozones. On the other hand, the Afrotropic ecozone \(as an example\) includes the Sahara and Namib deserts, as well as the tropical forests of Madagascar and central Africa, and the grasslands and savannahs of the Sahel—a variety of biomes.

### Differences between Terrestrial and Aquatic Biomes

Different biome types grade into one another; the boundaries between them are not sharp or distinct, and there are many variations \(which makes the classification of biomes particularly challenging\). However, there are two basic types of biome: terrestrial and aquatic. \(The biome concept has been more widely applied to terrestrial ecosystems than to aquatic ecosystems, where the term biotic zone is more commonly used.\) 

Obviously, terrestrial and aquatic environments differ fundamentally in their physical attributes; this affects the properties of ecosystems and the organisms that characterize them. In a terrestrial environment, the most important attributes that define a biome are usually temperature and precipitation, which, in turn, influence soil type. Other aspects of the physical environment—the strength of the wind, the moisture-retaining characteristics and chemistry of the soil, and the availability of sunlight, for example— also are of obvious importance in defining a biome and its inhabitants. In the aquatic environment, temperature is still a defining characteristic, but so are salinity and depth of the water. Other aspects of the physical and chemical environment, such as the acidity of the water and the vigor of wave action, are also fundamentally important. 

On land, plants and animals require structural support in order to survive and hold up against gravity. These supports mostly take the form of bones or woody parts, and their growth requires an enormous investment in energy for specialized tissue growth on the part of terrestrial organisms. In the water it is more common to find soft or floppy forms of plants and animals, because water is a more supportive medium than air. Because of gravity, it takes more energy for organisms to move on land than in the water, where they can swim or float with ease. Aquatic organisms—especially those that swim vigorously—tend to be streamlined to minimize drag. 

There also are differences in the resources available to organisms in terrestrial and aquatic environments. On land, organisms must remain near a source of water, which thus becomes a limiting resource. In aquatic environments, light may be in short supply, especially at great depths; therefore, photosynthetic organisms and those that feed directly on them, as well as plants that need to be rooted in bottom sediments, must remain in shallow or near-shore environments where light can penetrate. An adequate supply of light is not a problem in most terrestrial environments, with the exception of a few unusual locations such as caves, or the floor of a dense rain forest. The basic types of food also differ from terrestrial to aquatic biomes. Land plants mainly produce food energy in the form of carbohydrates; in the ocean, proteins are the main form of organic matter. Organic matter and mineral nutrients also tend to be unevenly distributed and poorly circulated in deep aquatic environments. 

Let’s have a closer look at terrestrial and aquatic biomes, their defining characteristics, and some important examples of them.
