# ENERGY AND MATTER IN ECOSYSTEMS

In the Arizona desert an exotic, futuristic structure rises above the landscape; it is Biosphere-II, the most ambitious human attempt ever to develop a closed, habitable system on Earth. It cost $120 million to build and had the best material seal ever produced. Eight people—four men and four women—lived in that closed system for two years, along with 3800 species of plants, nonhuman animals, and an unknown number of microorganisms. The goal was to demonstrate that people could produce their own food, recycle all their own wastes, and maintain a breathable atmosphere and healthy environment in a system completely closed to the exchange of matter with the universe outside.

The inhabitants came close to achieving their goal. But during the second year the oxygen concentration in Biosphere-II began to decline. When it reached an oxygen pressure equivalent to that found at 4500 m above sea level, a medical decision was made to open the air locks and provide some more oxygen for the health of the inhabitants. Throughout this experiment—when it was proposed, while it was being planned, and during its early stages of operations—many scientists suspected that the system would fail, and each gave a reason. Some suggested that the carbon dioxide level would get too high; others suggested that nitrates would not be removed rapidly enough by bacteria and would pollute the waters; still others suggested that a crop disease or an insect outbreak would make it impossible for the people to feed themselves. 

But nobody forecast an oxygen decline. The cause of that decline was found to be bacteria, which, in an atmosphere with elevated carbon dioxide, could break down compounds in the cement walls. In doing so, they used up oxygen as they respired. In terms of its stated goals, Biosphere-II failed, but it provided important insights and is the first example we have of a large-scale, human supporting, materially closed system. In the sealed container of Biosphere-II, the eight humans obtained food from the plants and animals they farmed. They depended on plants, algae, and bacteria to give off oxygen, which is necessary for animal life, and to remove carbon dioxide from the air they breathed out. They had to recycle water for drinking, washing, and irrigation, and all materials, including their own wastes. 

In short, their survival within the sealed structure depended on two primary processes: \(1\) flow of energy and \(2\) continual recycling of chemical elements. These are the two fundamental requirements for any life-supporting system. They provide a framework for our discussion of the ecosystem, the basic life-supporting system in which living organisms interact with each other and with the abiotic components of their environment.
