# Biogeochemical Links among the Spheres

## The Atmosphere 

We have seen that elements that occur in gaseous phases are much more readily transferred to biospheric reservoirs than elements that have no gaseous phase. Not surprisingly, among Earth’s spheres the atmosphere has had the greatest influence on the biosphere and has in turn been most affected by the biosphere. As discussed in Chapter 14, the Archean atmosphere provided the anaerobic conditions necessary for starting life. When life became autotrophic, the oxygen it produced created the oxygenated atmosphere that we know today. This had the most profound significance for life. Without respiratory metabolism, none of the attributes of “higher” life could likely have developed. And without the ozone \(O3\) of the upper atmosphere, there would have been insufficient protection from short-wave radiation for life to get a foothold on the land. 

Another atmospheric gas that is vital to the biosphere is carbon dioxide, CO2, the source of the carbon used by autotrophs to make carbohydrates by photosynthesis. The primary source of all CO2 was Earth’s mantle, through volcanoes. How much of the CO2 coming from volcanoes today is recycled from subducted surface materials and how much is new is uncertain, but probably most volcanic CO2 today is recycled. Of the total carbon that has been cycled through the biosphere, most is now locked up in carbonate rocks \(limestone\) and in organic sediments. The small amount of carbon dioxide that remains in the atmosphere is vital to autotrophs at the base of the global food web. It also has a climate-moderating influence as a greenhouse gas.

## The Hydrosphere 

Water is indispensable for the biosphere. As a chemical compound, water has many unique properties that are of fundamental importance to life \(Chapter 3\). The hydrosphere provides the medium for life in aquatic ecosystems. Globally, water either directly participates in or facilitates most environmental and biological interactions. Most of the gas exchange between aquatic ecosystems and the atmosphere is mediated by water. Water also provides the transfer medium for nutrients to move from soils into plant roots. Essential elements are transferred from the land \(soil\) to aquatic ecosystems by flowing water, either carried in solution or in suspension. In shallow aquatic environments \(rivers, most lakes, and the continental shelves\), essential material resources are recycled fairly rapidly; in the deep-sea environment, the cycles are longer and slower.

## The Geosphere 

Ultimately, the geosphere contributes all of the elements necessary to support life. The most important growth limiting element it contributes is phosphorus, which is released from the crust by weathering. Since the growth of most ecosystems is limited by phosphorus availability, weathering is an important regulator of total biomass. The geosphere gives up its phosphorus rather grudgingly from relatively insoluble minerals such as apatite \(calcium phosphate\). 

The geosphere, specifically the mantle, is also the source \(through volcanism\) of the carbon \(as CO2\) that is the starting point for synthesis of organic compounds in the biosphere. Although today most of this carbon has probably been recycled, the mantle itself must be given credit for the initial supply that made the prebiotic surface environment rich in CO2. 

Another interesting contribution of the mantle to life on Earth is the chemical energy for the small group of autotrophs that carry out primary production by chemosynthesis. In an expedition to the Galápagos rift in 1977, geologists in the small research submarine Alvin discovered submarine hot springs called black smokers. The deep sea is devoid of sunlight, so autotrophs cannot get their energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Instead the energy comes from chemical compounds suspended in the hot water. Bacteria are the primary producers in the unusual and diverse ecosystems that surround submarine hot springs. Living in complete darkness, they are chemoautotrophs, deriving energy from the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide \(H2S\) in the water discharged from the smokers. 

## Soil: A Biogeochemical Link

 Soil is weathered rock material that has been altered by the presence of living and decaying organisms, such that it can support rooted plant life. With its partly mineral, partly organic composition, in solid, liquid, and gaseous forms, soil provides a link between the geosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. Like liquid water, soil is one of the features that make Earth a unique planet. Soil is the base of almost all terrestrial ecosystems. The inorganic components of soil supply habitat to the organisms of the soil; together, they constitute an ecosystem of many species and great complexity. In addition, the inorganic constituents of soil act as a substrate, together with water, nutrients, and essential trace elements, for the larger ecosystem \(forest, prairie, or whatever it may be\).
