# Ecosystems

Think of a class project in which each member of a team has special skills that allow the team as a whole to exceed the capabilities of individuals working alone. Groups of organisms act in similar ways: individual organisms play roles that contribute to the survival of other organisms as well as their own. In the case of human groups, we accomplish this teamwork as a result of conscious decisions. For the organisms living together in a particular environment—referred to as a community—it happens through trial and error and involves feedbacks between the community and individuals. These feedbacks determine the structure and functioning of the community. 

Whether at local, regional, or global scales, the interactions of biological communities with their environments define organizational units known as **ecosystems**. Ecosystems are composed of biological and physical components that function in a balanced, interrelated fashion. Ecosystems occur at many different scales . They may be separated by geologic barriers such as mountains, deserts, or oceans at the largest scale, or by barriers such as different water temperatures within a single hot spring at a much smaller scale \(see the chapter opening photo\). But no matter how large or small they are, all ecosystems are characterized by a flow, or flux, of energy and matter between organisms and their environment.

A typical ecosystem might involve, say, a river and its surroundings, where different groups of organisms are adapted to live in the water \(fish\), in the sediment \(worms, snails\), on the banks \(grass, trees, muskrats\), and in the sky above \(birds, insects\). In one sense, the river controls where the organisms live by supplying the ecosystem with water, sediment, and dissolved mineral nutrients. Conversely, the organisms influence how the river behaves; for example, grass and trees stabilize the riverbanks against the destructive effects of floods. The balance between such biologically controlled and geologically controlled processes ensures the long-term stability of the ecosystem.

 Ecosystems respond sensitively to biological changes, such as the introduction of new groups of organisms. When severe imbalances in ecosystems occur, responses are often dramatic. Consider the effects of introducing a new organism into your neighborhood environment, such as a pretty new plant for your garden. In all too many cases, the new organism is better suited for its new environment than the current inhabitants and becomes invasive, multiplying rapidly and squeezing out the previous inhabitants  A successful invader often comes from a place where the physical environment is similar but where biological competition is less intense, so it is likely to win the battle for nutrients and space in its new home. Organisms that are squeezed out may become extinct if they are outcompeted by the invader in all the regions they formerly occupied. 

Earth’s history shows us that ecosystems respond sensitively to geologic processes as well. Impacts by meteorites, huge volcanic eruptions, and rapid global warming are just a few of the processes that have contributed to the extinction of major groups of organisms. We will explore some of their effects later in this chapter.
