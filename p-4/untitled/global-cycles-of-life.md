# GLOBAL CYCLES OF LIFE

Because organisms evolve, the biosphere itself has changed through time and is still changing today. The Earth system as a whole has undergone changes, driven—at least in part—by life processes. One way these changes can be seen is in the cyclical transfer of chemical elements among Earth’s four major reservoirs or subsystems—the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. The cycles of some elements have changed dramatically over Earth’s history, but the most marked changes have been in the biologically important elements carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Elements that are essential to and strongly influenced by the biosphere, that are transformed from organic to inorganic forms, and that move among biological and nonbiological reservoirs are said to undergo biogeochemical cycling.

In its most general form, a **biogeochemical cycle** is the complete pathway that a chemical element follows through the Earth system—from the geosphere to the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere, and back again. It is a chemical cycle because the cycling materials take various chemical forms and undergo chemical transformations. It is bio- because these are cycles that involve life processes and biological reservoirs. It is geo- because the cycles include rocks and soils. Although there are as many different biogeochemical cycles as there are elements, certain general concepts hold true for these cycles. The key that unifies biogeochemical cycles is the involvement of the four principal components of the Earth system: rock, air, water, and life.

You can look up the calcium cycle, the carbon cycle, the sulfur cycle, the nitrogen cycle, and the phosphorus cycle.
