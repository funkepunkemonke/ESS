# The Kingdoms of Life

Given the task of studying the enormous variety of life on this planet, biologists have sought to organize species into a hierarchy of **taxonomic ranks** \(the word taxonomy comes from the Greek word that means “order”\). Traditional biological classification was based on the work of early biologists such as Carl Linnaeus \(1701–1778\), who identified two major classes or **kingdoms** of living things: Animalia \(animals\) and Plantae \(plants\). Refinement of this two-kingdom scheme led to the Linnaean System of taxonomic classification, which is still used today. Through decades and centuries of subsequent work on the classification of living organisms, this simple scheme has been greatly expanded and refined to better account for the diversity of living organisms and their complex evolutionary histories and genetic relationships. 

Today, while there is still considerable discussion among biologists about the best way to categorize life, a classification scheme based on six kingdoms of life, rather than just the two identified by Linnaeus, is the most widely accepted taxonomic system. In the six-kingdom system \(FIG. 14.6\), all prokaryotes are said to belong to one of two kingdoms: Archaea \(formerly known as Archaebacteria\) or Bacteria \(also known as “true bacteria” or Eubacteria\). All living organisms that are not prokaryotes are eukaryotes, and all eukaryotes belong to one of four kingdoms: Protista \(single-celled and simple multicellular eukaryotes\); Fungi \(mushrooms, yeasts, molds, and their relatives\); Animalia \(animals, which are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that obtain their food by consuming other organisms\); or Plantae \(multicellular, sexually reproducing eukaryotes that produce their own food and are more complicated than algae\). The kingdoms are further subdivided, in a hierarchic manner, into successively narrower categories according to the traditional Linnaean classification scheme. 

Many biologists group the six kingdoms into three **domains** or super kingdoms—the highest taxonomic ranking of organisms. The three domains of life are not, as you might expect, Plants, Animals, and everything else; rather, they are Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. This gives us some perspective on the relative importance of microorganisms in general, and prokaryotes in particular, in the overall context of life on this planet. All animals, plants, fungi, and protists are placed together into a single taxonomic group \(Eukarya\) at the domain level, whereas it requires two groups of equivalent taxonomic rank \(Archaea and Bacteria\) to account for the prokaryotes. 

Many of the assignments of organisms to taxonomic rank based on traditional studies of morphological similarity are now being modified as new findings emerge concerning the complex genetic relationships among organisms. A taxonomy that organizes the forms of life into groupings according to their genetic and evolutionary relationships is called a phylogenetic tree \(phylogeny means “evolutionary relatedness,” and such groupings tend to take a branching form, hence “tree”\)
