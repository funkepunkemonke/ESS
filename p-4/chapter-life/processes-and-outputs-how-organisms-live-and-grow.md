# Processes and Outputs: How Organisms Live and Grow

**Metabolism** encompasses all the processes organisms use to convert inputs into outputs. In one type of metabolic process, organisms use small molecules, such as CO2, H2O, and CH4, and energy to create larger molecules, such as proteins and certain types of carbohydrates, that enable them to function and grow. Other carbohydrates— for example, a sugar called glucose—are stored for later use as an energy source—that is, food. In another type of metabolic process, organisms break down food to release the energy it contains.

One particularly well-known metabolic process is **photosynthesis**. Through this process, organisms such as plants and algae use energy from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates \(such as glucose\) and oxygen.

The oxygen is released into the atmosphere, and the glucose is stored as an energy source for future use by the organism. An important group of microorganisms known as the cyanobacteria also use photosynthesis to make carbohydrates; in fact, they probably originated the process early in life’s history.

The other key metabolic process is **respiration**, by which organisms release the energy stored in carbohydrates such as glucose. All organisms use oxygen to burn, or respire, carbohydrates to release energy, but different organisms respire in different ways. For example, humans and many other organisms consume oxygen gas \(O2\) from the atmosphere to metabolize carbohydrates, and they release carbon dioxide and water as by-products.

But other organisms, such as microorganisms that live in environments where oxygen is absent, have a more difficult task. They must break down oxygen-containing compounds dissolved in water, such as sulfate \(SO4 2\), to obtain oxygen. During the course of these reactions, various gases—such as hydrogen \(H2\), hydrogen sulfide \(H2S\), and methane \(CH4\)—may be produced as by-products. 

The metabolism of organisms affects the geologic components of their environment. For example, the oxygen released by photosynthesis reacts with iron-bearing silicate minerals such as pyroxene and amphibole to form ironbearing oxide minerals such as hematite \(see Chapter 16\). When organisms produce CO2 and CH4, they escape to the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. Conversely, when organisms consume these gases, they contribute to global cooling.
