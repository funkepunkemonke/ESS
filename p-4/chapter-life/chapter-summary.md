# Chapter Summary

**What is the biosphere?** • The Earth’s biosphere is the part of our planet that contains all its living organisms. It includes all the plants and animals as well as whole kingdoms of nearly invisible microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria that are astronomically more numerous than humans or the creatures that make up our visible world. Some microorganism live in the most extreme environments on Earth. • Because the biosphere intersects with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere, it can influence or even control basic geologic and climatic processes. Geobiology is the study of the interaction of these biosphere organisms with the Earth.

**What is metabolism and how does metabolism affect the Earth?** • Organisms can be subdivided into producers \(autotrophs\) or consumers \(heterotrophs\) according to the way they obtain their food. Autotrophs make their own food using sources of energy and nutrients. Heterotrophs feed directly or indirectly on autotrophs. • Metabolism is the process that all organisms use to convert inputs \(energy and nutrients\) to outputs \(stored energy as carbohydrates or fat and waste products\). For example, a photosynthetic plant uses sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen gas as a byproduct. Refer to Table 11.2. • As their metabolic processes operate, organisms continuously exchange energy and matter with their environment. Biochemical cycles are pathways that describe this exchange or flow. Important biochemical cycles include the carbon cycle \(Figure 11.3 and Table 11.2\), the phosphate cycle \(Figure 11.4\), and the sulfur cycle \(Figure 11.10\).

 **How important are microbes?** • Single-celled organisms including bacteria, some fungi and algae, and protozoa are known as microbes. Where there is water, there are microbes. • Microbes are the most abundant and diverse group of organisms on Earth. • Microbes were the first organisms to inhabit the Earth, and all other organisms are descended from them. Refer to Figure 11.5. • Extremophiles are microbes that live in environments that would kill other organisms. Refer to Table 11.3. • Microbes play a critical role in many geologic processes, such as mineral precipitation, mineral dissolution, and the flow of important elements through Earth’s crust.

 **How did life originate, and what signs do we have of life on the young Earth?** • Geoscientists continue to explore the mechanisms for how life originated on the primitive Earth. Laboratory experiments, like those by Stanley Miller \(Figure 11.13\), and studies of meteorites \(Figure 11.23\), the fossil record \(Figure 11.14\), rock chemistry, and modern organisms \(Figure 11.15\) are all filling in pieces of this puzzle. • The fossil record tells us that microbes originated first on Earth and that they evolved into all multicelled organisms. We can find fossil microbes in rocks 3.5 billion years old.

**Where did the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere originate?** • Earth’s atmosphere is thought to have been oxygenated by cyanobacteria that gave off oxygen gas as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The fossils and the occurrences of banded iron formations and red beds in the geologic record provide evidence for important mileposts in the history of interactions between life and environment. • An oxygen-rich surface environment set the stage for the evolution of Eukarya, including all multicellular animals. 

**What is the difference between radiation and extinction?** • A radiation is the relatively rapid development of new types of organisms that derive from a common ancestor. In contrast, extinction occurs when groups of organisms are no longer able to adapt to changing environmental conditions or compete with a superior group of organisms. Refer to Figure 11.17. • The Cambrian explosion, which marks the origination of all major animal groups, is an example of a radiation. Refer to Figure 11.19. • When many groups of organisms become extinct at the same time it is called a mass extinction. Refer to Figure 11.17, Earth Issues 11.1, Figure 9.18, and Table 9.2. 

**How do we search for life on other planets?** • The presence of liquid water over long periods of time \(hundreds of millions of years\) is considered to be a prerequisite for life. • On a planet too close to its star water will boil and become a gas, which can be lost to space over time. On a planet too far from its star, water will freeze into a solid. For every star, there is a habitable zone, marked by the distance away from the star to the point where water is stable as a liquid. If a planet is within the habitable zone, there is a chance that life might have originated there. Refer to Figure 11.24.
