# THE UNIVERSAL TREE OF LIFE

Biologists have learned how to use the genetic information contained in living organisms to understand which forms of life are most closely related to one another. This knowledge has allowed them to organize the hierarchy of ancestors and descendants into a universal tree of life. About 30 years ago, a startling discovery was made when the first family trees for microorganisms were constructed. When the genes for all types of microorganisms were compared, it was shown that, despite their similar sizes \(tiny\) and shapes \(simple rods and ellipses\), there were enormous differences in their genetic content. Furthermore, when the genes of all types of organisms, including plants and animals, were compared, it was revealed that the differences among groups of microorganisms were much greater than the differences between plants and animals, including humans.

## THE THREE DOMAINS OF LIFE 

The single root of the universal tree of life shown in the above figure is called the universal ancestor. This universal ancestor gave rise to three major groups, or domains, of descendants: the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukaryota. The Bacteria and Archaea appear to have evolved first; all of their descendants have remained single-celled microorganisms. The Eukaryota, thought to be the youngest branch of the tree, have a more complex cellular structure, which includes a cell nucleus that contains the genes. This structure made it possible for eukaryotes to evolve from small, single-celled organisms into larger, multicellular organisms—an essential step in the evolution of animals and plants. Precambrian microorganisms, like those living today, were tiny. The traces of individual microorganisms preserved in rocks are therefore called **microfossils**. Needless to say, such features are much harder to find than the macroscopic fossils of shells, bones, and twigs used by geologists to study the evolution of animals and plants during the Phanerozoic eon \(recall that Phanerozoic means “visible life”\). For geobiologists, the universal tree of life is a map that reveals how microorganisms relate to one another and interact with Earth. The names of microorganisms, such as Halobacterium, Thermococcus, and Methanopyrus, suggest that these organisms can live in extreme environments that are very salty \(halo, “halite”\), or hot \(thermo\), or high in methane \(methano\). Microorganisms that live in extreme environments are almost exclusively archaea and bacteria.
