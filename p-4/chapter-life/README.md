# Chapter 9: Life

Although life is a mystery in many respects, we do know that it is a planetary phenomenon—global in extent but unique to this particular planet, as far as we have discovered. Therefore, the Earth system is an appropriate and important context in which to consider fundamental questions about life. The discovery of a meteorite known to have originated on Mars and observed to contain structures that may be fossils of bacteria-like life forms makes this question all the more intriguing. Could life have existed at one time on Mars but died out as water and oxygen became scarce? Could it be that life— that is, a **biosphere**—is not just a phenomenon of Earth, but rather a more general phenomenon that requires just the right planetary size, complexity, and environmental conditions in order to originate and persist? Many complex issues are bound up in this question, and the first and most fundamental is the question “What is life?”
