# An Overview of Geologic Time

## The Origin of Earth and Its Global Geosystems

In 1788, after many years of geological study, James Hutton, one of the early pioneers of geology, wrote the following about the age of the Earth: “The result, therefore, of our present inquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning, — no prospect of an end.” Although he was not precisely correct \(there was a beginning and an end to planet Earth\), he was trying to express the vastness of geological time that humans have a hard time perceiving. Although Hutton did not assign an age to the Earth, he was the first to suggest that the planet was incredibly old. Today we know Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old, an age first calculated by Caltech professor Clair Patterson in 1956 by radiometrically dating meteorites with uranium-lead dating. \(Earle, 2015\)

On a **geologic scale,** the lifespan of a human is truly short, and we struggle to comprehend the depth of geologic time and slow geologic processes. Studying **geologic time**, also known as **deep time,** can help us overcome our limited view of Earth during our lifetime. For example, the science of earthquakes only goes back about 100 years; however, geologic evidence shows that large earthquakes have occurred in the past and will continue to occur in the future. Thus, the human perspective of time does not always overlap with geologic timescales.

 Within just 100 million years \(a relatively short time, geologically speaking\), the Moon had formed and Earth’s core had separated from its mantle. Exactly what happened during the next several hundred million years is hard to know. Very little of the rock record survived intense bombardment by the large meteorites that were constantly smashing into Earth. This early period of Earth’s history is appropriately called the geologic “dark ages.”

The oldest rocks now found on Earth’s surface are over 4 billion years old. Rocks as ancient as 3.8 billion years show evidence of erosion by water, indicating the existence of a hydrosphere and the operation of a climate system not too different from that of the present. Rocks only slightly younger, 3.5 billion years old, record a magnetic field about as strong as the one we see today, showing that the geodynamo was operating by that time. By about 3 billion years ago, enough low-density crust had collected at Earth’s surface to form large continental masses. The geologic processes that modified the continents after that time were very similar to those we see operating in plate tectonics today.

## The Evolution of Life

Life also began very early in Earth’s history, as we can tell from the study of **fossils,** traces of organisms preserved in the geologic record. Fossils of primitive bacteria have been found in rocks dated at 3.5 billion years ago. A key event was the evolution of organisms that release oxygen into the atmosphere and oceans. The buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere was under way by 2.7 billion years ago. Atmospheric oxygen concentrations probably rose to modern levels in a series of steps over a period as long as 2 billion years.

Life on early Earth was simple, consisting mostly of small, single-celled organisms that floated near the surface of the oceans or lived on the seafloor. Between 1 billion and 2 billion years ago, more complex life forms such as algae and seaweeds evolved. The first animals appeared about 600 million years ago, evolving in a series of waves. In a period starting 542 million years ago and probably lasting less than 10 million years, eight entirely new branches of the animal kingdom were established, including the ancestors of nearly all animals inhabiting Earth today. It was during this evolutionary explosion, sometimes called biology’s “Big Bang,” that animals with shells first left their fossils in the geologic record.

Although biological evolution is often viewed as a very slow process, it is punctuated by brief periods of rapid change. Spectacular examples are mass extinctions, during which many kinds of organisms suddenly disappeared from the geologic record. During the Paleozoic era, a mass extinction event called The Great Dying occurred. However, following that dramatic event, life became more diversified, including the evolution of the dinosaurs. The most recent mass extinction was caused by a large meteorite impact 65 million years ago. The meteorite, not much larger than 10 km in diameter, caused the extinction of half of Earth’s species, including the giant animals of that geologic era, the dinosaurs.
