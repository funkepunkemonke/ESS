# The Limitations and Challenges of Understanding Earth Systems

Earth system science is a young science with great potential, but we must exercise caution in not overlooking important details of traditional, disciplinary science in our attempt to develop this new and integrative science. The foundation upon which we will proceed in this book is to provide the basic disciplinary components, starting with fundamental concepts of modeling. Earth science, biology, and chemistry. Having reviewed these basic scientific building blocks we move on to a survey the biogeochemical cycles of key elements. Following this, we present a set of integrative topics. 

You will discover that the challenge of understanding Earth system science is at least as much of a problem of integration of well developed fundamental fields into a global context as it is to refine the disciplinary pieces themselves. Users who are practiced in a traditional field utilizing reductionism will need to expand their thinking into other disciplines as well as into the problem of how to combine their own field into the larger picture. In doing so, they will find an opportunity to extend the scope of their own discipline towards and into the global context.
