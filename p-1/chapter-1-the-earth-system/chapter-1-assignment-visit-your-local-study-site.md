  In this part of the investigation, you will visit a local study site, where
  you will get a chance to observe and interpret the four components of the
  Earth system and how they are connected.

# Exercise: Visit Your Local Study Site

{% hint style="info" %}
### Stop and Think: 

* Name something from each of the four spheres of the Earth system that you interact with every day.
* How do those things impact your life?
{% endhint %}

#### INSTRUCTIONS

Look around your study site. What do you see, hear, smell? Describe and analyze what you observe.

1. Where is your local study site in relation to your school? Is it in an urban, suburban, or rural area?
2. Approximately how big is your study site \(in feet or meters\)?
3. Identify some examples of the four major components of the Earth system:
   * atmosphere \(air, including wind, clouds, and precipitation\):
   * hydrosphere \(water\):
   * pedosphere \(soil\):
   * biosphere \(living things\):
4. Identify and record connections among the four components of the Earth system by: making observations; recalling and integrating your existing knowledge about them; and speculating carefully about the connections that might be taking place.
5. Take several photographs of the study site, with one in each of the four cardinal directions \(N, E, S, W\). The photographs should show as many as possible of the four major Earth system components.

**Notes:** An excellent list of interconnections will be long; it will involve all four of the components; it will be specific; it will bring in your knowledge from previous studies in other classes as well as this one; and it will show that you are thinking deeply and carefully about your study site.
