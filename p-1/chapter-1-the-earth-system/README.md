# Chapter 1: The Earth System

Much like a car or the human body, Earth is a complex system of interacting parts. Air, water, soil, and living things make up four overlapping, interconnected "spheres": the atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere. The study of the processes that move energy and matter among these four spheres is called Earth system science.  
  
In this chapter, you will learn more about Earth system science and the four interconnected spheres that make up the Earth system. In the exercise, you will visit and observe a local study site to familiarize yourself with the components of the Earth system and ways in which they interact and influence one another.  
  
After completing this investigation, you should be able to:

* identify the major components of the Earth system, and give examples from your local study site;
* infer connections among the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere by describing connections among examples at the study site; and
* predict some ways that changes in one component of the study site might affect changes in other components.

We will introduce the study of our complex natural world as an Earth system involving many interrelated components. Some of these components, such as the atmosphere and oceans, are clearly visible above Earth’s solid surface; others lie hidden deep within its interior. By observing the ways in which these components interact, scientists have built up an understanding of how the Earth system has changed through geologic time.

### Self-Reflection Survey:

Respond to the following questions as a means of uncovering what you already know about Earth and earth science. 

1. Which of the following earth science phenomena have you experienced? Which would you most like to experience? Can you think of three more things to add to the list?   
• A volcanic eruption   
• A glacier   
• A river in flood   
• A cave system   
• An underground mine   
• A canyon   
• An earthquake   
• An erosional coastline \(rocky cliffs\)   
• A depositional coastline \(beaches\)   
• A hot desert   
• A continental divide   
• Rock layers with fossils   
• A big, assembled dinosaur skeleton   
• A meteor shower or comet   
• The aurora borealis \(the northern lights\)  
 • A meteorite crater   
• A mountain range over 3,000 meters \(over 10,000 feet\) in elevation   
• The top of a cloud 

2. What three questions about Earth would you like to be able to answer by the end of this course?
