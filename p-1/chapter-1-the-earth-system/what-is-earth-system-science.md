# WHAT IS EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE?

**Earth system science** is the science that studies the whole planet as a system of innumerable interacting parts and focuses on the changes within and among those parts.

Examples of these parts are the ocean, the atmosphere, continents, lakes and rivers, soils, plants, and animals; each can be studied separately, but each is dependent on and interconnected with the others. Earth system science is a new approach to the study of Earth—a new science—and a new science requires new tools.

### Systems

We have used the word “system” to talk about Earth as an integrated whole. The system concept allows scientists to break down a large, complex problem into smaller, more easily studied pieces. A system is any portion of the universe that can be isolated from the rest of the universe for the purpose of observing and measuring changes. By saying that a system is any portion of the universe, we mean that the system can be whatever the observer defines it to be. That is why a system is only a concept; you choose its limits for the convenience of your study. It can be large or small, simple or complex. You could choose to observe the contents of a beaker in a laboratory experiment. Or you might study a flock of birds, a lake, a small sample of rock, an ocean, a volcano, a mountain range, a continent, or an entire planet. A leaf is a system; it is part of a larger system \(a tree\), which in turn is part of an even larger system \(a forest\).

The fact that a system is _isolated from the rest of the universe_ means that it must have a boundary that sets it apart from its surroundings. The nature of the boundary is one of the most important defining features of a system, allowing us to establish three basic kinds of systems—isolated, closed, and open—with different types of boundaries.

By _observing and measuring changes,_ we mean that we use the systems concept to study complex problems. This might mean observing what happens in a natural system under changing conditions, such as what happens in a wetland during a drought, or what happens to a dead organism as it decays on a forest floor, or what happens when magma rises in a volcano until it erupts. Or it might mean imposing changes on an artificial system in a laboratory, such as heating up a rock in a special crucible so that we can observe what happens as it melts.
