# History

Science has roots outside of the Eurasian peninsula known as Europe

Some of the earliest work in the study of biogeochemical cycles and their role in the physical functioning of the planet was by James Hutton \(1788\), who viewed the Earth as a "superorganism, and that its proper study should be by physiology." More than 100 years later, a classic paper by Svante Arrhenius \(1896\) appeared, called "On the influence of carbonic acid in the air on the temperature of the ground." This work provided a paradigm for quantitatively connecting the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide to climate, as well as to the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon. A truly meaningful study of these issues clearly requires input from nearly all of the natural sciences \(chemistry, physics, biology, geology, meteorology, etc.\). These scientific disciplines, which were still in their early formative stages when Arrhenius' pioneering work emerged, have since evolved over the past century into highly refined and useful, but largely separated entities. Accordingly, most scientists have adopted a reductionist approach to biogeochemistry \(i.e., simplifying large scientific problems into smaller parts to be examined by an individual discipline\). In contrast, as we stated above, one of the goals of Earth system science \(referred to early on as natural philosophy\) is to integrate the natural sciences to strive towards understanding the entire system.

In addition to the work of Arrhenius, several other scientists have made notable contributions that have helped to mold the approach and content of Earth system science \(and of this book\). The term biosphere was originally coined by the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess as a way of defining the parts of the Earth's surface that support life \(Suess, 1875\). The global view portrayed by Arrhenius' lengthy quote of the paper on the carbon cycle by Arvid Hogbom set the tone for coupling the biosphere to geochemistry \(Arrhenius, 1896\). This coupling was strongly emphasized and promoted by the Russian mineralogist Vladimir Ivanovich Vernadsky, who published a series of lectures on the subject, first in Russian \(1926\), then in French \(1929\), and recently translated into English \(1997\). In these writings, Vernadsky developed an integrative definition of the biosphere as all living things and everything connected to them. He strongly believed that the Earth is a set of connected parts that can only be studied in an indivisible, holistic way. Vernadsky went so far as to suggest that geologic phenomena at the Earth's surface are inherently caused by life itself, so his definition of the biosphere includes all of the Earth's geologic features. Vernadsky's teachings remained relatively obscure until Hutchinson \(1970\) popularized them in a famous article in Scientific American. Vernadsky came to be called the father of modem biogeochemistry by James Lovelock \(1972\), who went on to suggest that feedbacks in the biosphereclimatic system lead to homeostasis of basic Earth processes. Lovelock called this new feedback- based integrative science geophysiology and the system itself **Gaia**, which is a Greek word meaning Mother Earth. 

This view of the coupled nature of the Earth system has not dominated the historical development of the key disciplines of the natural sciences. Many evolutionary biologists have viewed the changing physical climate of the Earth as an externally imposed factor to which the biosphere must adapt. Likewise, many geologists and geophysicists have viewed the evolution of the planet as being governed primarily or exclusively by chemical and physical processes. Under this perspective, free oxygen in the atmosphere is viewed as a constant factor. The disparate views of the biological and geologic communities have coexisted for nearly a century, and \(with few exceptions\) their merging has been controversial \(see, e.g., Dawkins, 1976\). 

The __**Gaia hypothesis** was put forward by Lovelock together with Lynn Margulis \(Lovelock and Margulis, 1974\) to provide a single scientific basis for integrating all components of the Earth system. This theory suggests that Earth's biota as well as the planet itself are parts of a quasi-living entity that "has a capacity for homeostasis" \(or self-regulation\) \(Lovelock, 1986\). The earliest version of Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis contained phrases like "by and for the biosphere," which implied a sense of purposefulness on the part of the biota to evolve in ways that would suit its own continued existence. As the Gaia hypothesis has evolved, the interdependence of the evolution of biota and geophysical/geochemical systems is described in non-teleological terms. Lovelock \(1991\) himself recently stated what seems obvious: "In no way do organisms simply 'adapt' to a dead world determined by physics and chemistry alone. They live in a world that is the breath and bones of their ancestors and that they are now sustaining."
