## Summary

Earth system science is the holistic study of Earth as a system of many separate but interacting parts.

**How do we study Earth as a system of interacting components?** When we try to understand a complex system such as the Earth system, we find that it is often easier to focus on its subsystems \(which we call geosystems\). The full Earth system is made up of four overlapping, interacting "spheres."

* **Geosphere \(Lithosphere\):** the solid Earth \(rock materials on the surface and in Earth's interior layers\) and soil. 
* **Hydrosphere:** all of Earth's bodies of water, including groundwater. The hydrosphere also includes the **cryosphere**, which is made up of the world's ice sheets and sea ice. In this unit, we'll be concentrating only on liquid water.
* **Biosphere:** all living things, from microbes to humans and everything in between.
* **Atmosphere:** the blanket of gas that surrounds the entire planet and extends to the edge of space. The atmosphere includes air, precipitation, clouds, and atmospheric aerosols \(tiny particles suspended in the air\).

**What are some major events in Earth’s history?** Earth formed 4.56 billion years ago. Rocks as old as 4.3 billion years have survived in Earth’s crust. Liquid water existed on Earth’s surface by 3.8 billion years ago. Rocks about 3.5 billion years old show evidence of a magnetic field, and the earliest evidence of life has been found in rocks of the same age. By 2.7 billion years ago, the oxygen content of the atmosphere was rising because of oxygen production by early organisms, and by 2.5 billion years ago, large continental masses had formed. Animals appeared suddenly about 600 million years ago, diversifying rapidly in a great evolutionary explosion. The subsequent evolution of life was marked by a series of extreme events that killed off many species, allowing new species to evolve. A dramatic example was the impact of a large meteorite 65 million years ago. Our species, Homo sapiens, first appeared about 200,000 years ago.

## Questions

1. How does science differ from religion as a way to understand

   the world?

2. How does viewing Earth as a system of interacting components help us to understand our planet? Give an example of an interaction between two or more systems that could affect the geologic record.
3. Describe THREE reasons why the Earth is unique relative to other planets and how the reason makes Earth able to sustain life.
