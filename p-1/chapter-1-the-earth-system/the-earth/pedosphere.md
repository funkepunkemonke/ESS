#### The Plate Tectonic System <a id="joh_9781319324643_j13NidoozX"></a>

Some of Earth’s most dramatic geologic events—volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, for example—result from interactions within Earth’s interior. These phenomena are driven by Earth’s internal heat, which is transferred upward through the circulation of material in Earth’s mantle.

In some ways, the outer part of the solid Earth behaves like a ball of hot wax. Cooling of the surface forms a strong outer shell, or **lithosphere** \(from the Greek lithos, meaning “stone”\), which encases a hot, weak **asthenosphere** \(from the Greek asthenes, meaning “weak”\). The lithosphere includes the crust and the top part of the mantle down to an average depth of about 100 km. The asthenosphere is the portion of mantle, perhaps 300 km thick, immediately below the lithosphere. When subjected to force, the lithosphere tends to behave like a nearly rigid and brittle shell, whereas the underlying asthenosphere flows like a moldable, or ductile, solid.

According to the remarkable theory of plate tectonics, the lithosphere is not a continuous shell; it is broken into about a dozen large plates that move over Earth’s surface at rates of a few centimeters per year. Each lithospheric plate is a rigid unit that rides on the asthenosphere, which is also in motion. The lithosphere that forms a plate may vary from just a few kilometers thick in volcanically active areas to more than 200 km thick beneath the older, colder parts of continents. The discovery of plate tectonics in the 1960s led to the first unified theory that explained the worldwide distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes, continental drift, mountain building, and many other geologic phenomena. 

Why do the plates move across Earth’s surface instead of locking up into a completely rigid shell? The forces that push and pull the plates come from the mantle. Driven by Earth’s internal heat engine, hot mantle material rises at boundaries where plates separate, forming new lithosphere. The lithosphere cools and becomes more rigid as it moves away from these boundaries, eventually sinking back into the mantle under the pull of gravity at other boundaries where plates converge. This general process, in which hotter material rises and cooler material sinks, is called **convection**. Convection in the mantle can be compared to the pattern of movement in a pot of boiling water. Both processes transfer energy by the movement of mass, but mantle convection is much slower because the solid mantle rocks are much more resistant to deformation than ordinary fluids such as water.

The convecting mantle and its overlying mosaic of lithospheric plates constitute the **plate tectonic system.** As with the climate system \(which involves a wide range of convective processes in the atmosphere and oceans\), scientists use computer simulations to study the plate tectonic system and test the agreement of their models against observations. You will learn more about this in Chapter 3.

#### Soils

Soils make up a thin layer, called the **pedosphere**, that covers many of Earth's land surfaces. Although soil only accounts for about 10% of Earth's surface, it is a precious natural resource that deeply affects every other part of the ecosystem. Soils hold nutrients and water for plants and animals, filter and cleanse water, and affect the amount of water that returns to the atmosphere to form rain. The foods we eat and most of the materials we use for paper, buildings, and clothing are dependent on soils. Understanding soil helps us figure out where to build our houses, roads, buildings, and playgrounds.  
  
Important functions of soil include:

* Providing a nutrient-rich medium for agriculture
* Producing and storing gases such as carbon dioxide
* Storing heat and water
* Providing a home for billions of plants, animals and microorganisms
* Filtering water and wastes
* Providing raw source materials for construction, medicine, art, makeup, etc.
* Decomposing wastes
* Providing a snapshot of geologic, climatic, biological, and human history

#### Interactions Among Geosystems Support Life <a id="joh_9781319324643_FLnhZTF4UZ"></a>

The natural environment—the habitat of life—is largely controlled by the climate system. The biosphere participates as an active component of this geosystem, regulating, for example, the amount of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which in turn determines the planet’s surface temperature. 

Perhaps less obvious is the coupling of the natural environment to the other two global geosystems. Plate tectonics produces volcanoes that resupply the atmosphere and oceans with water and gases from Earth’s deep interior, and it is responsible for the tectonic processes that raise mountains. The interactions of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere with the surface topography create a variety of habitats that enrich the biosphere and, through the erosion of rock and dissolution of minerals, provide life with essential nutrients.
