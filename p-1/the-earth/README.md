# The Earth

> When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe. —John Muir, My First Summer in the Sierra, 1911

 **Earth system science** is the study of processes that move energy and materials among the pedosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere.

Earth is a unique place, home to a multitude of organisms, including ourselves. No other planet we have yet discovered has the same delicate balance of conditions necessary to sustain life. Earth is a terrestrial planet in the solar system, and it is like the other inner planets, at least in its size, shape, and composition. However, many features make Earth vastly different from the planets and any other planet that we know of so far. 

Earth is a sphere or, more correctly, an **oblate spheroid**, which is a sphere that is a bit squished down at the poles and bulges a bit at the equator. Alternatively, to be more technical, the minor axis \(the diameter through the poles\) is smaller than the major axis \(the diameter through the equator\). When the earth is cut into equal halves, each half is called a **hemisphere**. North of the equator in the northern hemisphere and south of the equator in the southern hemisphere. Eastern and western hemispheres are also designated. 

Even the ancient Greeks knew that Earth was round by observing the arc shape of the shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse. The Sun and the other planets of the solar system are also spherical. Larger satellites, those that have enough mass for their gravitational attraction to have made them round, are as well.

Geology is the science that studies Earth: how it was born, how it evolved, how it works, and how we can help preserve its habitats for life. Geologists seek answers to many basic questions: Of what material is the planet composed? Why are there continents and oceans? How did the Himalaya, Alps, and Rocky Mountains rise to their great heights? Why are some regions subject to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions while others are not? How did Earth’s surface environment and the life it contains evolve over billions of years? What changes are likely in the future? We think you will find the answers to such questions fascinating.

Earth system science integrates a variety of other Earth sciences: geology, hydrology, chemistry, botany & zoology, and meteorology. The full Earth system is made up of four overlapping, interacting "spheres."

* **Geosphere \(Lithosphere\):** the solid Earth \(rock materials on the surface and in Earth's interior layers\) and soil. 
* **Hydrosphere:** all of Earth's bodies of water, including groundwater. The hydrosphere also includes the **cryosphere**, which is made up of the world's ice sheets and sea ice. In this unit, we'll be concentrating only on liquid water.
* **Biosphere:** all living things, from microbes to humans and everything in between.
* **Atmosphere:** the blanket of gas that surrounds the entire planet and extends to the edge of space. The atmosphere includes air, precipitation, clouds, and atmospheric aerosols \(tiny particles suspended in the air\).

All the parts of our planet and all their interactions, taken together, constitute the **Earth system**. Although Earth scientists have long thought in terms of natural systems, it was not until the late twentieth century that they had the tools to investigate how the Earth system actually works. Networks of instruments and Earth-orbiting satellites now collect information about the Earth system on a global scale, and computers are powerful enough to calculate the mass and energy transfers within the system. 

Although we think of Earth as a single system, it is a challenge to study the whole thing all at once. Instead, we will focus our attention on the particular parts of the Earth system \(subsystems\) that we are trying to understand.
