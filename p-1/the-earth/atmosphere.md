The atmosphere is more than just the air we breathe. It also includes wind, clouds, and precipitation. This thin layer of gas that envelops Earth, traps heat to keep us warm; protects us from harmful radiation; drives ocean currents that distribute heat and help regulate climate; brings rain to thirsty crops; and much more.

The atmosphere also includes aerosols, which are tiny particles suspended in the air. Typical examples of aerosols include the salt in sea spray, smoke from fires, smog, and dust. Aerosols can have negative impacts on human health. Changes in air quality due to increased concentrations of aerosols can worsen heart and lung diseases like asthma and bronchitis. Aerosols sometimes collect or get deposited in soil and bodies of water, which can lead to acidification and extensive ecosystem damage. The presence of aerosols in the atmosphere can also influence Earth's radiative balance and climate by scattering incoming sunlight, destroying ozone in the stratosphere, and increasing cloud formation.

**Weather** is the term we use to describe the temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, and winds observed at a particular location and time on Earth’s surface. We all know how variable the weather can be—hot and rainy one day, cool and dry the next—depending on the movements of storm systems, warm and cold fronts, and other atmospheric disturbances. Because the atmosphere is so complex, even the best forecasters have a hard time predicting the weather more than a week in advance. However, we can guess in rough terms what our weather will be much further into the future, because weather is governed primarily by the changes in solar energy input on seasonal and daily cycles: Summers are hot, winters cold; days are warmer, nights cooler. The **climate** produced by these weather cycles can be described by averaging temperatures and other variables over many years of observation. A complete description of climate also includes measures of how variable the weather has been, such as the highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded on a given day of the year.



The **climate system** includes all the Earth system components that determine climate on a global scale and how climate changes with time. In other words, the climate system involves not only the behavior of the atmosphere, but also its interactions with the hydrosphere, cryosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere.

When the Sun warms Earth’s surface, some of the heat is trapped by water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases in the atmosphere, similar to the way heat is trapped by frosted glass in a greenhouse. This **greenhouse effect** explains why Earth has a climate that makes life possible. If its atmosphere contained no greenhouse gases, Earth’s surface would be frozen solid! Therefore, greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, play an essential role in regulating climate. As we will learn in later chapters, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a balance between the amount spewed out of Earth’s interior in volcanic eruptions and the amount withdrawn during the weathering of silicate rocks. In this way, the behavior of the atmosphere is regulated by interactions with the lithosphere.

 To understand these types of interactions, scientists build numerical models—virtual climate systems—on large computers, and they compare the results of their computer simulations with data from their observations. A particularly urgent problem to which these models are being applied is the global warming that is being caused by anthropogenic \(human-generated\) emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Part of the public debate about global warming centers on the accuracy of predictions based on computer models. Skeptics argue that even the most sophisticated computer models are unreliable because they lack many features of the real Earth system.
