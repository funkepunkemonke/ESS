The **biosphere** is the region of the earth that encompasses all living organisms: plants, animals and bacteria. "Bio" means life, and the term biosphere was first coined by a Russian scientist \(Vladimir Vernadsky\) in the 1920s.  

Life on Earth exists in even the most unexpected places including inside rocks on and below the Earth's surface, beneath oceans and polar ice, and even floating in the air. Earth's unique weather and climate make it "just right" for life. The existence of life is what sets Earth apart from other planets in our solar system.

#### **Is the Biosphere Living?**

 The **Gaia hypothesis** states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as **homeostasis**. For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

The biosphere also impacts climate. Plants use energy from the sun to undergo photosynthesis, a process that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and adds oxygen. Animals \(and humans\) breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Human activities like burning fossil fuels or forests, also add greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. These gases can trap heat and keep it from escaping into space, thus contributing to an overall warming of the planet.

Connections between the biosphere and the hydrosphere and pedosphere are also extremely important. All living things need water to survive. Many plants rely on soil for valuable nutrients, and in turn, people and animals rely on those plants for food.
