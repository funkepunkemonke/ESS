**Water** is simply two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen bonded together. Despite its simplicity, water has remarkable properties. Water expands when it freezes, has high surface tension \(because of the polar nature of the molecules, they tend to stick together\), and others. Without water, life might not be able to exist on Earth and it certainly would not have the tremendous complexity and diversity that we see.

Nearly three quarters of our planet is covered by water. All bodies of water including oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, and **groundwater** are part of the hydrosphere. Earth’s oceans contain 97% of the planet’s water, so just 3% is fresh water, water with low concentrations of salts. Most fresh water is trapped as ice in the vast glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland.

The hydrosphere plays several very important roles in the Earth system. Water is essential for life. Many plants and animals call water their home, but  _all_ plants and animals need water to survive. People also use water every day for things like industry and transportation, recreation, and making electricity.  
  
Oceans, which contain over 97% of Earth's water, help regulate global climate by absorbing large amounts of solar energy and circulating heat from the equator toward the poles through currents. Surface ocean currents are also affected by winds in the atmosphere. Energy from the wind gets transferred to the top layers of the ocean and helps circulate ocean water. Water is constantly moving between the hydrosphere, pedosphere, and atmosphere through plant transpiration \(evaporation of water from plant leaves\).
