# Science and Society

Why should you care about science—and earth science in particular? Most of us are removed from the process of science. \(How many scientists do you know?\) Past experiences have convinced some people that they will never understand science, whereas others may view the study of earth science as irrelevant to our comfortable twenty-first-century lifestyle. Many citizens are understandably bewildered by media reports that portray battling teams of scientists presenting opposing explanations for complex scientific problems. If the experts cannot agree, they reason, how can we be expected to make a decision? Besides, even if we understand environmental problems, we are often frustrated by the apparent inability of those responsible to do anything about them. This can range from simple individual actions \(Why doesn’t my neighbor recycle?\) to issues of corporate responsibility \(Why do companies produce air pollution?\).

In this context, society may refer to anything from a small town up to the global community. Here we suggest a simple three-step process: know, care, act. 

• Know. We must take responsibility for our world by knowing how it works. 

• Care. Our society works best when we care about how our actions affect others. But we should also be aware of how we are affected by the actions of others. 

• Act. Do something. Make your opinion known. Go to a town meeting, blog about it, write a letter to your local paper, contact your congressperson or senator, vote. To quote anthropologist Margaret Mead: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”
