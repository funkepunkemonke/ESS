# Limitations of Science

We must keep in mind that scientific explanations may be limited by available technology or other factors. For example, prior to the invention of the telescope, knowledge about Earthâ€™s position in space was based on observations made with the naked eye. Astronomers such as Galileo used some of the first telescopes to make observations of planetary orbits that would support the hypothesis that the sun, not Earth, was the center of our solar system. 

Although science is a powerful method for examining unresolved questions, science cannot answer all questions. Questions that center on ethics or theology often have more to do with cultural or social norms than with scientific concepts. For example, recent concerns about the potential for cloning humans can be separated into two distinct questions; one is scientific, the other ethical. Can we successfully clone humans? is a scientific question, and the current answer is no, although research suggests that a future response could be yes. Should we clone humans? is an ethical question. If the answer is no, we may never clone a person even if the scientific knowledge exists to do so.
