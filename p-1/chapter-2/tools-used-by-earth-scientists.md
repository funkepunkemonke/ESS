# Tools Used by Earth Scientists

Earth scientists use direct measurements, indirect information, and models to better understand Earth. Direct measurements are collected at field locations by scientists or trained technicians For example, they might determine the type of rocks present to create a geologic map, collect water samples from drinking water wells , or gather samples of gases erupting from volcanoes. Samples are carefully analyzed and cataloged with information about their original location, the conditions under which they were obtained, and any other data that could affect understanding of the importance of that sample. In these cases, the scientist is directly measuring exactly what she is interested in measuring. The actual measurements may be obtained in the field or in a laboratory. 

However, it is often not practical to measure some phenomena directly. In these cases, scientists use indirect measurements. Essentially, they measure something that they can then interpret to get a value for something else. For example, scientists cannot readily examine the features below the world’s oceans, but they have been able to use a variety of methods to identify different properties of the rocks of the ocean floor. Measurements of the magnetic patterns of the ocean floor were used to determine that the age of the oceanic crust varied from place to place. Satellites measure variations in the height of the ocean surface which is related to the distribution of ridges and trenches on the ocean floor. Satellites can also make direct measurements of large regions that would be impossible to map on the surface. For example, scientists have used satellite measurements of Arctic sea ice coverage to show a steady decline over the last few decades. 

In other cases, scientists use models to better understand Earth. Those models can be physical devices such as wave tanks , or they may be theoretical models. The latter are often computer models that simulate complex physical processes to allow investigators to examine the relationships between variables. For example, it has become commonplace for us to see the results of meteorological modeling on our evening news weather forecasts. Elsewhere atmospheric scientists use an array of models to predict the track of hurricanes, and ever more sophisticated models are being developed to predict future climate trends.

### Stop and Think

Go to the US Geological Survey site \(www.usgs.gov\) and find an example of an earth science topic that USGS scientists have investigated.   
1. Briefly describe the research, using no more than six sentences.   
2. Identify:   
• The types of questions the scientists investigated.   
• The types of tools the scientists used.   
• An example of the data they collected.
