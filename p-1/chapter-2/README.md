![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2871%29.png)

The second word in the term _earth science_ is just as important to us as the first. Much of what you learn in college about science will happen in this and perhaps one other course. Therefore, we want you to have a firm understanding of what science is—and what it is not. Science is not a list of facts to be memorized that have no relevance to your life. Just ask **Tilly Smith**’s parents. The only way to understand how to think like a scientist is to learn to use the skills of scientific reasoning. So in this chapter, and throughout the book, we will give you lots of examples to show that science is a process, a way of thinking about the natural world. 

In this chapter, you will learn more about the scientific process. In the exercise, you will review your visit to a local study site to annotate and diagram the components of the Earth system and ways in which they interact and influence one another.  
  
After completing this investigation, you should be able to:

* Identify the meaning of science, understand why it is important, and discover ways you can get involved
