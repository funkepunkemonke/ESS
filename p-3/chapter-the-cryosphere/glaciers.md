# Glaciers

Wherever the amount of snow falling each winter is greater than the amount that melts during the following summer, the snow pack grows progressively thicker. Gradually, the deeper snow recrystallizes into denser ice under the increasing weight of overlying snow. When the snow and ice become so thick that the pull of gravity causes the frozen mass to move, a glacier is born. Accordingly, we define a glacier as a persistent body of ice, consisting largely of recrystallized snow, which shows evidence of slow downslope or outward movement under the influence of gravity.

Glaciers vary considerably in shape and size. We recognize several fundamental types:

A. The smallest, a cirque glacier, occupies a protected, bowl-shaped depression \(a cirque\) on a mountainside that is produced by glacial erosion.

B. A cirque glacier that expands outward and downward into a valley becomes a valley glacier.

C. Ice caps cover mountain highlands or low lying land at high latitudes and generally flow radially outward from their center.

D. Along some high-latitude seacoasts, nearly every large valley glacier occupies a deep fjord, the drowned seaward end of a glacier carved bedrock trough. Such glaciers are called fjord glaciers.

E. When a valley glacier flows all the way out of the mountains and spreads out onto the surrounding lowlands, it is called a piedmont glacier.

Many of Earth’s high mountain ranges contain glacier systems that include glaciers tens of kilometers long, each heading in one or several cirques. Huge continent-sized **ice sheets** overwhelm nearly all the land surface within their margins. Earth’s large ice sheets, which are now confined to Greenland and Antarctica, include about 95 percent of the ice in existing glaciers and reach thicknesses of 3000 m or more. Several small ice sheets are found among the Canadian Arctic islands. Floating ice shelves hundreds of meters thick occupy large embayments along the coasts of Antarctica. Ice shelves are a form of sea ice, which we will discuss in greater detail later in the chapter.

### How Glaciers Form

Newly fallen snow is open and porous. As a result of compaction over the course of a year or more, accumulated snow gradually becomes denser and denser until it is no longer permeable to air, at which point it becomes glacier ice. Although now a rock, glacier ice has a far lower melting temperature than any other naturally occurring rock, and its low density—about 0.9 g/cm3—means it will float in water. 

Further changes take place as the ice becomes buried deeper and deeper within a glacier. As snowfall adds to the glacier’s thickness, the increasing pressure causes initially small grains of glacier ice to grow until, near the base of the ice sheet, they reach a diameter of 1 cm or more. This increase in grain size is similar to what happens in a fine-grained sedimentary rock that is buried deep within Earth’s crust. As the rock is subjected to high pressure over a long time, recrystallization occurs and larger, interlocking mineral grains slowly develop. The accumulation of layer upon layer of glacial ice eventually becomes the perennially frozen mass that we know as a glacier or an ice sheet.

### Distribution of Glaciers

A glacier can develop anywhere that the snowline intersects the topography and snow and ice are able to accumulate. This explains why glaciers are found not only at sea level in the polar regions, where the snowline is low, but also near the equator, where some lofty peaks in New Guinea, East Africa, and the Andes rise above the snowline. As we might expect, most glaciers are found in the high-latitude polar regions, the coldest regions of our planet. However, because low temperatures also occur at high altitudes, glaciers also can exist in lower latitudes on high mountains.

Low temperature is not the only factor that determines where glaciers can form, for a glacier must receive a continuing input of snow. Proximity to a moisture source is therefore another requirement. The abundance of glaciers in the coastal mountains of northwestern North America, for example, is related mainly to the abundant precipitation received from air masses moving landward from the Gulf of Alaska. Farther inland in the same latitude zone, the Rocky Mountains contain fewer and smaller glaciers because the climate there is much drier. Thus, the existence of glaciers is linked to the interaction of several Earth systems: tectonic forces that have produced high mountains; the adjacent ocean, which provides an abundant source of moisture; and the atmosphere, which delivers the moisture to the land as snow.

### Why Glaciers Change

Nearly all high-mountain glaciers have shrunk substantially in recent decades, exposing extensive areas of valley floor that only a century ago were buried beneath thick ice. Other glaciers have remained relatively unchanged, however, and a few have even expanded. To understand why glaciers advance and retreat, and why glaciers in the same region can show dissimilar behavior, we need to examine how a glacier responds to a gain or loss of mass.

The mass of a glacier is constantly changing as the weather varies from season to season and, on longer time scales, as local and global climates change. We can think of a glacier as being analogous to a checking account in a bank. The balance in the account at the end of the year is the difference between the amount of money added during the year and the amount removed. The balance of a glacier’s account is measured in terms of the amount of snow added, mainly in the winter, and the amount of snow \(and ice\) lost, mainly during the summer. The additions are called **accumulation**, and the losses are **ablation**. The total in the account at the end of a year—in other words, the difference between accumulation and ablation—is a measure of the glacier’s mass balance. The account may have a surplus \(a positive balance\) or a deficit \(a negative balance\), or it may have exactly the same amount at the end as at the beginning of a year.

When, over a period of years, a glacier gains more mass than it loses, its volume increases. The front, or terminus, of the glacier is then likely to advance as the glacier grows. Conversely, a succession of years in which negative mass balance predominates will lead to retreat of the terminus. If no net change in mass occurs, the terminus is likely to remain relatively stationary.

### How Glaciers Move

The terminus of a glacier shifts in response to changes in the mass balance, but the entire glacier itself is also moving—flowing—under the influence of gravity. One way to prove that glaciers move is to walk out onto a glacier near the end of the summer and carefully measure the position of a surface boulder with respect to some fixed point beyond the glacier margin. Measure the position of the same boulder again a year later and you will likely find that the boulder has moved up to several meters in the down-glacier direction. Actually, it is the ice that has moved, carrying the boulder along for the ride. 

What causes a glacier to move may not be immediately obvious, but we can find clues by examining the ice and the terrain on which it lies. These clues tell us that ice moves in two primary ways: by internal flow and by sliding of the basal ice across rock or sediment.

#### Internal Flow

When an accumulating mass of snow and ice on a mountainside reaches a critical thickness, the mass begins to deform and flow downslope under the pull of gravity. Flow takes place through movement within individual ice crystals, which are subjected to higher and higher stress as the weight of the overlying snow and ice increases. Under this stress, ice crystals are deformed by slow displacement \(termed creep\) along internal crystal planes in much the same way that cards in a deck of playing cards slide past one another if the deck is pushed from one end. As the compacted, frozen mass begins to move, stresses between adjacent ice crystals cause some to grow at the expense of others, and the resulting larger crystals end up with their internal planes oriented in the same direction. This alignment of crystals leads to increased efficiency of flow because the internal creep planes of all crystals now are parallel. 

In contrast to deeper parts, where the ice flows as a result of internal creep, the surface portion of a glacier has relatively little weight on it and is brittle. Where a glacier passes over an abrupt change in slope, such as a bedrock cliff, the surface ice cracks as tension pulls it apart. When a crack opens up, it forms a crevasse, a deep, gaping fissure in the upper surface of a glacier, generally less than 50 m deep. Continuous flow of ice prevents crevasses from forming at depths greater than about 50 m. Because it cracks at the surface and yet flows at depth, a glacier is analogous to the outer part of Earth’s geosphere, which includes a surface zone that cracks and fractures \(the brittle lithosphere\) and a deeper zone \(in the upper mantle\) that can flow slowly.

#### Basal Sliding

Ice temperature is very important in controlling the way a glacier moves and its rate of movement. Meltwater at the base of a temperate glacier acts as a lubricant and permits the ice to slide across its bed \(the rock or sediment on which the glacier rests\). In some temperate glaciers, such sliding accounts for up to 90 percent of the total observed movement. By contrast, polar glaciers are so cold that they are frozen to their bed. Their motion largely involves internal deformation rather than basal sliding, and so their rate of movement is greatly reduced.

#### Calving

During the last century and a half, many coastal Alaskan glaciers have receded at rates far in excess of typical glacier retreat rates on land. Their dramatic recession is characterized by frontal calving, the progressive breaking off of icebergs from the front of a glacier that terminates in deep water. Although the base of a fjord glacier may lie far below sea level along much of its length, its terminus can remain stable as long as it is resting \(or “grounded”\) against a shoal \(a shallow submarine ridge. However, if the terminus retreats off the shoal, water will replace the space that had been occupied by ice. With the glacier now terminating in water, conditions are right for calving. Once started, calving will continue rapidly and irreversibly until the glacier front recedes into water too shallow for much calving to occur, generally near the head of the fjord.

Icebergs produced by calving glaciers constitute an ever-present hazard to ships in subpolar seas. In 1912, when the S.S. Titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean, the detection of approaching bergs relied on the sharpness of sailors’ vision. Today, with sophisticated electronic equipment, large bergs can generally be identified well before an encounter. Nevertheless, ice has a density of 0.9 gm/cm3 \(compared to 1.0 gm/cm3 for water\), which means that 90 percent of an iceberg lies under water, making it difficult to detect. In coastal Alaska, where calving glaciers are commonplace, icebergs pose a potential threat to huge oil tankers. For this reason, Columbia Glacier, which lies adjacent to the main shipping lanes from Valdez at the southern end of the Alaska Pipeline, is being closely monitored as its terminus pulls steadily back and multitudes of bergs are released.

#### Glacial Surges 

Although most glaciers flow slowly and grow or shrink as the climate fluctuates, some experience episodes of unusual behavior marked by rapid movement and dramatic changes in size and form. Such an event, called a surge, is unrelated, or only secondarily related, to a change in climate. When a surge occurs, a glacier seems to go crazy. Ice in the accumulation area begins to move rapidly down-glacier, producing a chaos of crevasses and broken pinnacles of ice in the ablation area. Medial moraines, ****which are bands of rocky debris marking the boundaries between adjacent tributary glaciers, are deformed into intricate patterns. In some cases, a glacier terminus has advanced up to several kilometers during a surge. Rates of movement as great as 100 times those of non-surging glaciers and averaging as much as 6 km a year have been measured. The cause of surges is still not fully understood, but available evidence supports a reasonable hypothesis. The weight of the ice can produce high pressure in water trapped at the base of a glacier. Over a period of years, this steadily increasing pressure may cause the glacier to separate from its bed. The resulting effect is similar to the way a car hydroplanes on a wet road surface. According to this hypothesis, as the ice is floated off its bed, its forward mobility is greatly increased and it moves rapidly forward before the water escapes and the surge stops.
