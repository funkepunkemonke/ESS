# SEA ICE

Snow and glacial ice originate as precipitation, but some ice forms by the solidification of water at the surface, without falling as precipitation. Approximately two thirds of the area of Earth’s persistent ice cover floats as a thin veneer of **sea ice** on polar oceans. It is vast in its extent, but sea ice comprises only about 1/1000 of Earth’s total volume of ice.

An interesting feature of sea ice is that it consists of fresh water; the salt that is characteristic of seawater is excluded from the ice crystals as they form. Thus the formation of sea ice is one of the important Earth processes that control the salinity of ocean water. In periods of global coolness, when more sea ice forms, the ocean becomes saltier; in periods of global warmth, when sea ice melts, fresh water is released and the ocean becomes less salty.

### How Sea Ice Forms 

Once the ocean surface cools to the freezing point of seawater, slight additional cooling leads to ice formation. The first ice to form consists of small crystalline platelets and needles up to 3 or 4 mm in diameter that collectively are termed frazil ice. As more ice crystals form, they produce a soupy mixture at the ocean surface. In the absence of waves or turbulence, the crystals freeze together to form a continuous cover of ice 1 to 10 cm thick. If waves are present, the crystals form rounded, pancake-like masses up to 3 m in diameter that eventually weld together into a continuous sheet of sea ice.

Once a continuous cover of ice forms, the cold atmosphere is no longer in contact with the seawater, and sea-ice growth then proceeds by the addition of ice to the sea-ice base. In the Arctic, over the course of a yearly cycle, about 45 cm of ice is lost from the ice surface, but an equal amount is added to the base. As a result, an ice crystal added to the sea ice at its base will move upward through the ice column with an average velocity of about 45 cm/yr until it reaches the surface and melts away.

### Sea-Ice Distribution and Zonation

The contrasting geography of Earth’s north and south polar regions leads to important differences in the distribution of sea ice in the two hemispheres. The South Pole lies near the middle of the Antarctic continent, which is covered by a vast, thick ice sheet, whereas the North Pole lies in the middle of the deep Arctic Ocean basin. The open Southern Ocean adjacent to Antarctica contrasts with the largely landlocked Arctic Ocean, which is connected to the world ocean only by relatively narrow straits. In the Antarctic region, sea ice forms a broad ring around the continent and adjacent ice-covered archipelago, a ring that varies in width with the seasons. At its greatest northward extent in winter it covers 20 million km2, but it shrinks to only 4 million km2 in summer. By contrast, the Arctic Ocean is ice-covered most of the year, and several marginal seas \(i.e., the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Ohkotsk, the Bering Sea, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay\) are partially or wholly ice-covered during the winter. At its minimum extent in September, Arctic sea ice has typically covered about 6 million km2, whereas during its winter maximum in March it expands to 14 million km2. However, the maximum extent of sea ice in the Arctic has been declining; 2007 and 2008 were among the worst years yet recorded, with the summer ice extent shrinking to just over 4 million km2 in both years.

Scientists commonly categorize sea-ice zones as being either perennial or seasonal. The perennial ice zone contains sea ice that persists for at least several years \(multiyear ice\). In the Arctic, this zone lies north of 75° latitude and contains about two-thirds of all perennial sea ice. Near the center of the basin, the ice has an average thickness of 3 to 4 m and an age of several decades. In the Antarctic, multiyear ice is restricted to semi enclosed seas \(such as the Ross and Weddell seas, which can be seen in Fig. 9.7\), where it reaches a thickness of up to 5 m but an age of less than five years. In the seasonal ice zone, the ice cover varies annually. In the Arctic, ice of the seasonal zone is less than 2 m thick where it has not been deformed by wind and ocean currents, but deformation within the pack ice often increases thickness substantially. In the Southern Ocean, the limit of seasonal ice shifts, on average, through 10° of latitude. Here, the ice front retreats poleward in summer largely in response to heat derived from the ocean water, whereas in the Arctic, surface melting that results from warmer air temperature in the summer is a major factor in the retreat of the ice margin.

### Sea-Ice Motion

Sea ice is in constant motion, driven by winds and ocean currents. Annual changes in the extent, character, and motion of sea ice can now be studied using radar imaging systems carried on orbiting satellites. Average drift rates in the Arctic Ocean are about 7 km/day, whereas in the Greenland and Bering seas velocities reach 15 km/day. Each year, about 10 percent of the Arctic Sea ice moves south into the Greenland Sea, where it eventually breaks up and melts away. Sea ice generally moves clockwise around Antarctica, but a large circulation system called a gyre in the Weddell Sea, east of the Antarctic Peninsula, causes the drifting ice to pile up to form a large region of multiyear ice. 

Stresses resulting from diverging movement of the thin ice cover cause it to break, exposing the underlying water. Such a linear opening, called a lead, tends to be long and narrow and may extend for many kilometers. An exceptionally large lead may grow to become a huge area of open water called a polynya \(several can be seen in Fig. 9.7; one is just below and to the left of McMurdo Station\). Because of the large temperature gradient between the air and seawater in a lead, the water loses heat rapidly, causing a new, thin cover of ice to form quickly. As a result, the fractured ice pack becomes a changing complex mosaic of new ice and older ice. Although the exposure of surface water to the atmosphere permits substantial amounts of solar energy to reach the upper ocean, such open water commonly comprises less than 1 percent of the total area of the winter sea-ice cover. 

Early explorers who tried to reach the North Pole by crossing the Arctic ice pack quickly found it rough going. The ice is not a vast smooth surface; rather, it is broken by numerous pressure ridges, formed when the shifting, fractured ice converges, shears, and piles up, in much the same way that converging lithospheric plates produce mountain chains on the continents. Beneath each pressure ridge is a submerged keel of deformed ice, much like the keel of a sailboat, up to five times as thick as the overlying ridge. Estimates suggest that as much as 40 percent of the mass of Arctic sea ice is contained in such deformation features. In the Antarctic, pressure ridges are far less common because prevailing winds and currents tend to disperse the pack ice, shifting it away from the continent at rates as high as 65 km/day.
