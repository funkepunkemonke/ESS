# Private Water Wells

### Types of wells

There are three types of private drinking water wells. 

* **Dug/Bored wells** are holes in the ground dug by shovel or backhoe. They are lined \(cased\) with stones, brick, tile, or other material to prevent collapse. Dug wells have a large diameter, are shallow \(approximately 10 to 30 feet deep\) and are not cased continuously.
* **Driven wells** are constructed by driving pipe into the ground. Driven wells are cased continuously and shallow \(approximately 30 to 50 feet deep\). Though driven wells are cased, they can be contaminated easily because they draw water from aquifers near the surface. These wells draw water from aquifers near the surface.
* **Drilled wells** are constructed by percussion or rotary-drilling machines. Drilled wells can be thousands of feet deep and require the installation of casing. Drilled wells have a lower risk of contamination due to their depth and use of continuous casing. 

### Well components



Below are descriptions of the basic components found in a private water well.

* **Well Casing** is the tube-shaped structure placed in the well to maintain the well opening from the target ground water to the surface. Along with grout, the casing keeps dirt and excess water out of the well. This helps prevent contaminants from less desirable groundwater from entering the well and mixing with the drinking water. Some states and local governing agencies have laws that require minimum lengths for casing. The most common materials for well casing are carbon steel, plastic, and stainless steel. Local geology often dictates what type of casing can be used.
* **Well Caps** are placed on top of the well casing to prevent debris, insects, or small animals from getting into the well. Well caps are usually made of aluminum or plastic. They include a vent to control pressure during well pumping.
* **Well Screens** are attached to the bottom of the casing to prevent too much sediment from entering the well. The most common well screens are continuous slot, slotted pipe, and perforated pipe.
* **Pitless Adapter** is a connector that allows the pipe carrying water to the surface to remain below the frost line. It provides ensures that a sanitary and frost-proof seal is maintained.
* **Jet Pumps** are the most commonly used pumps for shallow wells \(depth of 25 feet or less\). Jet pumps are mounted above ground and use suction to draw water from the well.
* **Submersible Pumps** are the most commonly used pumps for deep private wells. The pumping unit is placed inside the well casing and connected to a power source on the surface.

### Well location and construction <a id="well"></a>

Proper well location and construction are key to the safety of your well water. The well should be located so rainwater flows away from it. Rainwater can pick up harmful bacteria and chemicals on the landâ€™s surface. If this water pools near your well, it can seep into it and potentially cause health problems. The Center for Disease Control \(CDC\) has an excellent [web page on well siting](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/location.html).

## Potential Well Water Contaminants and Their Impacts

Drinking water can expose people to a variety of harmful pollutants and pathogens. Public water systems use water treatment and monitoring to protect consumers from such contaminants. Generally, private wells do not receive the same services that wells supplying the public do. Well owner's are responsible for protecting their drinking water. To do so, a well owner must be aware of their well's potential for contamination and the possible [health effects those potential contaminants can have](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/private/wells/diseases.html).



* [**Microorganisms**](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#Microorganisms) ****include bacteria, viruses, and parasites. They can be found all over the [surface of our planet](https://coastal.er.usgs.gov/soil-pathogens/) and are found in [human sewage](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/csossoRTC2004_chapter06.pdf) and animal waste. People that consume drinking water containing microorganisms can experience[ gastrointestinal illnesses](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/surveillance/drinking-surveillance-reports.html) and infections. Water run-off from rainfall or snow-melt can contaminate private wells by washing microorganisms into the well system or seeping underground. Leakage of waste from underground storage tanks and effluent from septic leach fields can reach a water source and result in microorganisms being present in water wells.
* * [**Nitrate**](https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/estimated-nitrate-concentrations-groundwater-used-drinking) **and** [**nitrite**](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/chemical-contaminant-rules) are present in [chemical fertilizers](https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/commercial-fertilizer-purchased), [human sewage](https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/supporting-innovations-reduce-nitrogen-pollution-septic-systems), and [animal waste and fertilizers](https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/estimated-animal-agriculture-nitrogen-and-phosphorus-manure). They can contaminate a private well through groundwater movement and surface water seepage and water run-off. Once taken into the body, nitrates are converted into nitrites. High levels of nitrate and nitrite are most serious for infants. High levels of nitrate/nitrite in drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia or "blue baby syndrome". These substances reduce the blood's ability to carry oxygen. This acute condition can occur rapidly over a period of days. Symptoms include shortness of breath and blueness of the skin. Infants below six months who drink water with high levels of nitrate can become seriously ill and die.  
* [**Heavy metals**](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#Inorganic) can leach into drinking water from household plumbing and service lines, mining operations, petroleum refineries, electronics manufacturers, municipal waste disposal, cement plants, and natural mineral deposits. Heavy metals include: arsenic, antimony, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, selenium and many more. Heavy metals can contaminate private wells through groundwater movement and surface water seepage and run-off. People that consume high levels of heavy metals risk acute and chronic toxicity, liver, kidney, and intestinal damage, anemia, and cancer. 
* [**Organic chemicals**](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#Organic) are found in many house-hold products and are used widely in agriculture and industry. They can be found in inks, dyes, pesticides, paints, pharmaceuticals, solvents, petroleum products, sealants, and disinfectants. Organic chemicals can enter ground water and contaminate private wells through waste disposal, spills, and surface water run-off. People that consume high levels of organic chemicals may suffer from damage to their kidneys, liver, circulatory system, nervous system, and reproductive system.  
* [**Radionuclides**](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations#Radionuclides) ****are [radioactive](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-basics) forms of [elements ](http://periodic.lanl.gov/metal.shtml)such as uranium and radium. They are harmful to humans and can be released into the environment from  uranium mining and milling, coal mining, and [nuclear power production](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/operating/ops-experience/tritium/rn-groundwater.html). Radionuclides may also be naturally present in ground water in some areas. Radionuclides can contaminate private wells through groundwater flow, waste water seepage and flooding. Drinking water with radionuclides can cause toxic kidney effects and increase the risk of cancer. 
* [**Fluoride**](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-06/documents/npwdr_complete_table.pdf) ****can be present in many aquifers and can be found in private wells. Fluoride can be helpful in preventing tooth decay. However, excessive consumption of fluoride can cause skeletal fluorosis, a condition characterized by pain and tenderness of bones and joints.  Excess consumption of fluoride during formative period of tooth enamel may cause dental fluorosis, tooth discoloration and/or pitting of teeth.
