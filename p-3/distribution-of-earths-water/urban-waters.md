# Urban Waters



#### In Urban Environments, Small Impacts Add Up

Cities share one key characteristic: they're full of people, buildings and businesses. Because everyone shares the same relative space, air and water, environmental impacts are concentrated in smaller areas, including waterways.

Urban waters take on large amounts of pollution from a variety of sources, including industrial discharges, mobile sources \(e.g., cars/trucks\), residential/commercial wastewater, trash and polluted stormwater runoff from urban landscapes. As urban populations often share centralized water sources, this pollution creates public and environmental health hazards like lowered drinking water quality and water bodies that aren't safe to swim in.

Also, urban patterns of development often make waterways inaccessible to adjacent neighborhoods. Lack of access limits a community's ability to reap the benefits of living so close to the water, whether through recreation, fishing or access to real estate.

But if maintained properly, urban waters can also yield positive impacts for populations in both urban and upstream communities:

* Public spaces along rivers and lakes offer residents opportunities for **community gatherings**, **recreation** and **environmental education**. Public spaces also provide places and activities families and neighborhoods can enjoy together, such as:
  * Boating
  * Swimming
  * Fishing
  * Picnics
* In addition, increased access to waterways can spur the **creation of new jobs and the growth of local businesses**, including:
  * cleaning up polluted or abandoned properties
  * opening businesses along the waterfront
  * [green infrastructure projects](http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/index.cfm#tabs-2) and working on other water protection

New and different environmental challenges are appearing everywhere from the Anacostia River in Washington, DC to the waterfront in Dubuque, Iowa. The range of challenges we face are going to require both traditional and innovative strategies -- and broad partnerships to address the local issues in our communities, and the national issues we all share.

#### Why Should This Matter To You?

Water quality touches all of us every day: through the water we drink from the tap, shower and swim in, and use to water our plants and crops with. Your local water utility serves a key role – treating wastewater and drinking water – but ensuring access to clean waters and the land surrounding them starts with you, your neighbors and local community organizations.

Working hand-in-hand, community groups and local residents can help set up water quality monitoring, volunteer cleanup efforts and coalitions to speak out about water quality concerns to community leaders. By pooling efforts, your voice and hard work make the difference to your local waterways and to the community that depends on them.

## The Urban Waters Cycle

### Urban Waters: A Cycle of Change

The EPA Urban Waters Program is anchored in a simple cycle of change: linking water quality improvements to self-determined community priorities generates broader support and sustains the long-term efforts needed to restore urban water quality. The program strives to create a "virtuous cycle," as illustrated by the image below, which connects people to their urban waters and engages them in restoration, generates new momentum for urban water quality restoration efforts, and improves the surrounding neighborhoods and communities.

### Be Part of the Solution to Urban Waters Pollution

#### Around The House

* **Use nontoxic household products.** Want to reduce the number of chemicals in your home and in your waterways? Start by purchasing nontoxic household products such as nontoxic cleaning supplies, laundry products, paints, insecticides, and pool chemicals. If your local store does not carry nontoxic products, ask them to start.
* **Dispose of hazardous household products properly.** Don't toss hazardous household chemicals down the drain. Contact your local public works, sanitation, or environmental health department and find out if your city has a hazardous waste collection day. If your city doesn't have a local program, ask them to start one.
* **Save water.** Don't let the water run while brushing your teeth or washing your face. Run your dishwasher and washing machine only when they are full. Fix leaky plumbing fixtures and switch to low-flow toilets and showerheads. Changing small habits can save more than 100 gallons of water a week.
* **Recycle.** Deposit waste in a trash can. Never flush non-degradable products or sweep debris into the street or storm sewer. Trash can damage city sewer systems and end up littered on beaches and in your water.
* **Don't flush old prescription drugs down the drain \(unless directed\).** Wastewater treatment plants are unable to remove drugs from sewer system water and they end up in our rivers and streams.
* **Don't let pollutants go down the drain, inside OR outside.** Urban waters take on large amounts of pollution from a variety of sources, including polluted runoff from urban landscapes, which creates public and environmental health hazards. Remember, what goes on the ground and down your drain eventually ends up in the water. Don't dump oil, gasoline, solvents, paint, or other household chemicals down your household drains or storm drain.
* **Recycle used motor oil and maintain your car.** Throwing motor oil in the trash is illegal and harmful to your water source. Recycling centers and many service stations accept used motor oil for recycling. Also, be sure to keep up with regular car maintenance to prevent oil, coolant, antifreeze, or other hazardous chemicals from leaking onto the ground.
* **Take your car to a car wash.** A commercial car wash reclaims its wastewater using special filtration systems. This not only conserves water, but minimizes polluted runoff entering local storm drain.

#### In Your Landscape

* **Think Green – Spring is Right Around the Corner**. With spring right around the corner and lawn preparation underway, now is a good time to take a look at your yard’s watering system. You may not think of your hose and gutters as a “system” but they both can help direct water where you want it most – on your lawn and plants vs. down the storm drains. Instead of directing your gutter downspouts into your driveway or street, direct the rainwater collected by your roof to water your lawn or garden. Help your yard soak up free water, while keeping your water bill down and keeping dirty rainwater out of your local streams and rivers, like the Anacostia.

* **Learn about watering restrictions.** Over-watering your lawn or garden can not only be bad for your plants, but it can increase the leaching of fertilizers into ground and eventually your water. Avoid watering your landscape during the hottest hours of the day \(10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\) to minimize evaporation. Don't water your lawn on windy days when most of the water blows away or evaporates. Water your plants deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth and drought tolerance. Adhere to your community's irrigation guidelines.
* **Use natural fertilizers.** Try using a natural fertilizer such as manure, compost, mulch, or peat. These natural fertilizers should be available at your local garden supply or hardware store. You can also make your own compost, which is better for your lawn or garden and nearly free.
* **Landscape with native plants and natural materials.** Landscaping materials such as vegetation, gravel, mulch, and wood allows rainwater to runoff directly into the ground and seep into the soil. Use native and drought-tolerant plants in your garden that require less water and use less herbicides, pesticides, and fertilizers.
* **Collect and reuse rainwater.** Use rain barrels to capture and reuse water and/or consider planting a rain garden to naturally collect and absorb rainwater.

#### In Your Community

* **You can educate others in your community.** Educate family, friends, and neighbors in your community about the effects of dumping waste, such as pesticides, down drains and into waterways. Encourage your family, friends, and neighbors to install low flow water fixtures and to practice water conservation.
* **Get involved.** There are many public recreational areas that can use your help. Volunteer for a beach or park cleanup, plant a tree, or help maintain your local park.
* **Support low impact development.** Learn more about low impact development and how it might best work in your community. The [Nonpoint Education for Municipal Officials \(NEMO\) Program](http://nemonet.uconn.edu/) has lots of great information on their website.
