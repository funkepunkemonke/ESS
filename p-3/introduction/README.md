 Earth’s oceans contain 97% of the planet’s water, so just 3% is fresh water, water with low concentrations of salts. Most fresh water is trapped as ice in the vast glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland. A storage location for water such as an ocean, glacier, pond, or even the atmosphere is known as a **reservoir**. A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very quickly or may remain for much longer. The amount of time a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time.

**The goals and objectives of this chapter are to:**

* Understand the distribution of Earth's water around the world.
* Describe the anatomy of a stream and it's components.
* Explain what a divide is and how it influences streams.
* Analyze and describe the importance and functions of wetlands.
* Describe the impacts of floods.
* Determine the influence groundwater has on fresh water around the planet. 
* Describe the significance of the Earth's oceans.
* Compare and contrast the differences between surface and deep ocean currents.
