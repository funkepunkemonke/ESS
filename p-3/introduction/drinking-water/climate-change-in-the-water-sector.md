# Climate Change in the Water Sector

 **Climate change is changing our assumptions about water resources**. As climate change warms the atmosphere, altering the hydrologic cycle, changes to the amount, timing, form, and intensity of precipitation will continue. Other expected changes include the flow of water in watersheds, as well as the quality of aquatic and marine environments. These impacts are likely to affect water quality, public health, and safety.
