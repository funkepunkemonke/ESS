# Lead in Drinking Water

EPA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) agree that there is no known safe level of lead in a child's blood. Lead is harmful to health, especially for children.

#### How Lead Gets into Drinking Water

Lead can enter drinking water when plumbing materials that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content that corrodes pipes and fixtures. The most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. In homes with lead pipes that connect the home to the water main, also known as lead services lines, these pipes are typically the most significant source of lead in the water.  Lead pipes are more likely to be found in older cities and homes built before 1986.  Among homes without lead service lines, the most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and plumbing with lead solder.

The Safe Drinking Water Act \(SDWA\) has reduced the maximum allowable lead content -- that is, content that is considered "lead-free" -- to be a weighted average of 0.25 percent calculated across the wetted surfaces of pipes, pipe fittings, plumbing fittings, and fixtures and 0.2 percent for solder and flux.

#### Health Effects of Exposures to Lead in Drinking Water

**Is there a safe level of lead in drinking water?**

The Safe Drinking Water Act requires EPA to determine the level of contaminants in drinking water at which no adverse health effects are likely to occur with an adequate margin of safety. These non-enforceable health goals, based solely on possible health risks, are called maximum contaminant level goals \(MCLGs\). EPA has set the maximum contaminant level goal for lead in drinking water at zero because lead is a toxic metal that can be harmful to human health even at low exposure levels. Lead is persistent, and it can bioaccumulate in the body over time.

Young children, infants, and fetuses are particularly vulnerable to lead because the physical and behavioral effects of lead occur at lower exposure levels in children than in adults. A dose of lead that would have little effect on an adult can have a significant effect on a child. In children, low levels of exposure have been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing, and impaired formation and function of blood cells.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \(CDC\) recommends that public health actions be initiated when the level of lead in a child’s blood is 5 micrograms per deciliter \(µg/dL\) or more.

It is important to recognize all the ways a child can be exposed to lead. Children are exposed to lead in paint, dust, soil, air, and food, as well as drinking water. If the level of lead in a child's blood is at or above the CDC action level of 5 micrograms per deciliter, it may be due to lead exposures from a combination of sources. EPA estimates that drinking water can make up 20 percent or more of a person’s total exposure to lead. Infants who consume mostly mixed formula can receive 40 percent to 60 percent of their exposure to lead from drinking water.

**Children**

Even low levels of lead in the blood of children can result in:

* Behavior and learning problems
* Lower IQ and hyperactivity
* Slowed growth
* Hearing problems
* Anemia

In rare cases, ingestion of lead can cause seizures, coma and even death.

**Pregnant Women**

Lead can accumulate in our bodies over time, where it is stored in bones along with calcium. During pregnancy, lead is released from bones as maternal calcium and is used to help form the bones of the fetus. This is particularly true if a woman does not have enough dietary calcium. Lead can also cross the placental barrier exposing the fetus to lead. This can result in serious effects to the mother and her developing fetus, including:

* Reduced growth of the fetus
* Premature birth

**Adults**

Lead is also harmful to adults. Adults exposed to lead can suffer from:

* Cardiovascular effects, increased blood pressure and incidence of hypertension
* Decreased kidney function
* Reproductive problems \(in both men and women\)

### What You Can Do

#### Find Out if Lead is in Your Drinking Water

**First, learn more about the water coming into your home**

EPA requires all community water systems to prepare and deliver an annual water quality report called a _**Consumer Confidence Report \(CCR\)**_ for their customers by July 1 of each year. Contact your water utility if you'd like to receive a copy of their latest report. If your water comes from a household well or other private water supply, check with your health department, or with any nearby water utilities that use ground water, for information on contaminants of concern in your area.

**Second, you can have your water tested for lead**

Homes may have internal plumbing materials containing lead. Since you cannot see, taste, or smell lead dissolved in water, testing is the only sure way of telling whether there are harmful quantities of lead in your drinking water. A list of certified laboratories are available from your state or local drinking water authority. Testing costs between $20 and $100. Contact your water supplier as they may have useful information, including whether the service connector used in your home or area is made of lead.



#### Important Steps You Can Take to Reduce Lead in Drinking Water

* **Have your water tested**. Contact your water utility to have your water tested and to learn more about the lead levels in your drinking water.
* **Learn if you have a lead service line**. Contact your water utility or a licensed plumber to determine if the pipe that connects your home to the water main \(called a service line\) is made from lead.
* **Run your water.** Before drinking, flush your home’s pipes by running the tap, taking a shower, doing laundry, or doing a load of dishes. The amount of time to run the water will depend on whether your home has a lead service line or not, and the length of the lead service line. Residents should contact their water utility for recommendations about flushing times in their community.
* **Learn about construction in your neighborhood.** Be aware of any construction or maintenance work that could disturb your lead service line. Construction may cause more lead to be released from a lead service line.
* **Use cold water.** Use only cold water for drinking, cooking and making baby formula. Remember, boiling water does not remove lead from water.
* **Clean your aerator.** Regularly clean your faucet’s screen \(also known as an aerator\). Sediment, debris, and lead particles can collect in your aerator. If lead particles are caught in the aerator, lead can get into your water.
* **Use your filter properly.** If you use a filter, make sure you use a filter certified to remove lead. Read the directions to learn how to properly install and use your cartridge and when to replace it. Using the cartridge after it has expired can make it less effective at removing lead. Do not run hot water through the filter.

#### Get Your Child Tested to Determine Lead Levels in His or Her Blood

A family doctor or pediatrician can perform a blood test for lead and provide information about the health effects of lead. State, city or county departments of health can also provide information about how you can have your child's blood tested for lead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that public health actions be initiated when the level of lead in a child’s blood is 5 micrograms per deciliter \(µg/dL\) or more.

#### Find Out if Lead in Drinking Water is an Issue in Your Child's School or Child Care Facility

Children spend a significant part of their days at school or in a child care facility. The faucets that provide water used for consumption, including drinking, cooking lunch, and preparing juice and infant formula, should be tested.
