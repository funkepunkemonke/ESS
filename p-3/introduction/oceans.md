The oceans make up 70 percent of the planet and contains 97 percent of all the water on Earth. The vast amount of water stores the majority of the planet's moisture, terrestrial energy, and heat from the Sun. This energy is transferred between the equator and the two poles by larger surface currents by winds and deep ocean currents driven by differences in ocean density. It also provides the moisture and energy for storm systems and ultimately global climates.

Phytoplankton, microscopic plants and animals in the oceans provide the foundation of the global food web of species. The earth's oceans are so vital for life that over 40 percent of the world's population live 7.4 billion people near coastal areas.

## COMPOSITION OF OCEAN WATER

 Water is a polar molecule so it can dissolve many substances such as salts, sugars, acids, bases, and organic molecules. Where does the salt in seawater come from? As water moves through rock and soil on land it picks up ions. This is the flip side of weathering. Salts comprise about 3.5% of the mass of ocean water, but the salt content or **salinity** is different in different locations.  
  
In places like estuaries, seawater mixes with fresh water, causing salinity to be much lower than average. Where there is lots of evaporation but little circulation of water, salinity can be much higher. The Dead Sea has 30% salinity—nearly nine times the average salinity of ocean water. It is called the Dead Sea because nearly nothing can survive within it because of its salinity. Earthquide has an [interactive ocean maps](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/earthguide/diagrams/levitus/index.html) can show salinity, temperature, nutrients, and other characteristics.  
  
Differences in water density are responsible for deep ocean currents. With so many dissolved substances mixed in seawater, what is the density \(mass per volume\) of seawater relative to fresh water? Water density increases as: salinity increases; temperature decreases; pressure increases.

## Surface Currents

 Ocean water moves in predictable ways along the ocean surface. **Surface currents** can flow for thousands of kilometers and can reach depths of hundreds of meters. These surface currents do not depend on weather; they remain unchanged even in large storms because they depend on factors that do not change.

Surface currents are created by three things: _global wind patterns_, the _rotation of the Earth_, and the _shape of the ocean basins_.  
  
Surface currents are extremely important because they distribute heat around the planet and are a major factor influencing climate around the globe.

### GLOBAL WIND CURRENTS

 Winds on Earth are either global or local. **Global winds** blow in the same directions all the time and are related to the unequal heating of Earth by the Sun -- that is, more solar radiation strikes the equator than the polar regions –- and the rotation of the Earth -- that is, the **Coriolis effect**. The causes of the global wind patterns will be described in detail later when we look at the atmosphere. Water in the surface currents is pushed in the direction of the major wind belts:

* **trade winds**: east to west between the equator and 30 degrees North and 30 degrees South
* **westerlies**: west to east in the middle latitudes
* **polar easterlies**: east to west between 50 degrees and 60 degrees north and south of the equator and the north and south pole

### ROTATION OF THE EARTH

Wind is not the only factor that affects ocean currents. The Coriolis effect describes how Earth’s rotation steers winds and surface ocean currents. Coriolis causes freely moving objects to appear to move to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The objects themselves are actually moving straight, but the Earth is rotating beneath them, so they seem to bend or curve.



An example might make the Coriolis effect easier to visualize. If an airplane flies 500 miles due north, it will not arrive at the city that was due north of it when it began its journey. Over the time it takes for the airplane to fly 500 miles, that city moved, along with the Earth it sits on. The airplane will therefore arrive at a city to the west of the original city \(in the Northern Hemisphere\), unless the pilot has compensated for the change. So to reach his intended destination, the pilot must also veer right while flying north.

As wind or an ocean current moves, the Earth spins underneath it. As a result, an object moving north or south along the Earth will appear to move in a curve, instead of in a straight line. Wind or water that travels toward the poles from the equator is deflected to the east, while wind or water that travels toward the equator from the poles gets bent to the west. The Coriolis effect bends the direction of surface currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere.

When a surface current collides with land, the current must change direction. In the figure below, the Atlantic South Equatorial Current travels westward along the equator until it reaches South America. At Brazil, some of it goes north and some goes south. Because of Coriolis effect, the water goes right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere.

## Deep Currents

 **Thermohaline circulation** drives deep ocean circulation. Thermo means heat and haline refers to salinity. Differences in temperature and in salinity change the density of seawater. So thermohaline circulation is the result of density differences in water masses because of their different temperature and salinity.

What is the temperature and salinity of very dense water? Lower temperature and higher salinity yield the densest water. When a volume of water is cooled, the molecules move less vigorously so same number of molecules takes up less space and the water is denser. If salt is added to a volume of water, there are more molecules in the same volume so the water is denser.  
  
Changes in temperature and salinity of seawater take place at the surface. Water becomes dense near the poles. Cold polar air cools the water and lowers its temperature, increasing its salinity. Fresh water freezes out of seawater to become sea ice, which also increases the salinity of the remaining water. This very cold, very saline water is very dense and sinks. This sinking is called **downwelling**.  
  
Two things then happen. The dense water pushes deeper water out of its way and that water moves along the bottom of the ocean. This deep water mixes with less dense water as it flows. Surface currents move water into the space vacated at the surface where the dense water sank. Water also sinks into the deep ocean off of Antarctica. Since unlimited amounts of water cannot sink to the bottom of the ocean, water must rise from the deep ocean to the surface somewhere. This process is called [**upwelling**](http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/upwelling.html).

![illustration of upwelling](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/upwelling.jpg)

Generally, upwelling occurs along the coast when wind blows water strongly away from the shore. This leaves a void that is filled by deep water that rises to the surface. Upwelling is extremely important where it occurs. During its time on the bottom, the cold deep water has collected nutrients that have fallen down through the water column. Upwelling brings those nutrients to the surface. Those nutrient support the growth of plankton and form the base of a rich ecosystem. California, South America, South Africa, and the Arabian Sea all benefit from offshore upwelling.  
  
Upwelling also takes place along the equator between the North and South Equatorial Currents. Winds blow the surface water north and south of the equator so deep water undergoes upwelling. The nutrients rise to the surface and support a great deal of life in the equatorial oceans.

## Biologically Rich

The oceans are an essential part of Earth’s water cycle. Since they cover so much of the planet, most evaporation comes from the ocean, and most precipitation falls on the oceans.

## Continental Margins

Recall from the chapter on Plate Tectonics that the ocean floor is not flat. Mid-ocean ridges, deep-sea trenches, and other features all rise sharply above or plunge deeply below the abyssal plains. Earth’s tallest mountain is Mauna Kea volcano, which rises 10,203 m \(33,476 ft.\) from the Pacific Ocean floor to become one of the volcanic mountains of Hawaii. The deepest canyon is also on the ocean floor, the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench, 10,916 m \(35,814 ft\). The mapping of the ocean floor and coastal margins is called **bathymetry**. 

The **continental margin** is the transition from the land to the deep sea or, geologically speaking, from continental crust to oceanic crust. More than one-quarter of the ocean basin is the continental margin.  


## Layers of the Ocean

In 1960, two scientists in a specially designed submarine called the **Trieste** descended into a submarine trench called the Challenger Deep \(10,910 meters\). The average depth of the ocean is 3,790 m, a lot shallower than the deep trenches but still an incredible depth for sea creatures to live in. Three significant factors make the deep ocean hard to inhabit: the absence of light, low temperature, and extremely high pressure. The National Weather Service as information on the [layers of the ocean](https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/layers_ocean). \(Layers of the Ocean \| Physical Geography, n.d.\)

#### Vertical Divisions

To better understand regions of the ocean, scientists define the **water column** by depth. They divide the entire ocean into two zones vertically, based on the light level. Large lakes are divided into similar regions. Sunlight only penetrates the sea surface to a depth of about 200 m, creating the **photic** **zone** \(consisting of the Sunlight Zone and Twilight Zone\). Organisms that photosynthesize depend on sunlight for food and so are restricted to the photic zone. Since tiny photosynthetic organisms, known as **phytoplankton**, supply nearly all of the energy and nutrients to the rest of the marine food web, most other marine organisms live in or at least visit the photic zone. In the aphotic zone \(consisting of the Midnight Zone and the Abyss\), there is not enough light for photosynthesis. The **aphotic** **zone** makes up most of the ocean, but has a small amount of its life, both in the diversity of type and numbers.

#### Horizontal Divisions

The seabed is also divided into the zones described above, but the ocean itself is separated horizontally by distance from the shore. Nearest to the shore lies the **intertidal** **zone**, the region between the high and low tidal marks. This hallmark of the intertidal is changed, where water is in constant motions from ocean waves, tides, and currents. The land is sometimes underwater and sometimes is exposed. The **neritic** **zone** is from low tide mark and slopes gradually down to the edge of the seaward side of the continental shelf. Some sunlight penetrates the seabed here. The **oceanic** **zone** is the entire rest of the ocean from the bottom edge of the neritic zone, where sunlight does not reach the bottom.
