# Exercise: A Year in the Life of the Earth System

### Introduction

 Throughout this book, you have been examining Earth as a system of interacting partsâ€”first from a local perspective, then from a regional point of view, and finally at the global scale. Until now, you have been looking at the Earth system at a single point in time. However, the Earth is constantly changing, every second, every day, every year. In order to fully understand the Earth as a system and how its components interact with each other, you need to consider change over time. _How do the atmosphere, hydrosphere, pedosphere, and biosphere change over the course of a year? What relationships exist between components of the Earth system at the global scale?_

## Part A: The Earth System in the last 20 years

In this part of the investigation, you will work in small groups to examine 12 monthly images of the variable/dataset you explored in Lab 5, looking for any changes that occur over the course of the most recent year. 

1. Go to the [NASA Earth Observations \(NEO\) Global Maps website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps).

2. Select and display the dataset you explored in Lab 5.

3. Watch the animation several times through, looking for changes over time.

4.  With your group, identify annual cycles for your variable by answering the following **Stop and Think** questions. **Hint:** if you are having trouble locating significant changes, try focusing your attention on one location on the image throughout the year.

5. Designate a spokesperson to report your group's observations.

6. Share your discoveries of patterns and your interpretation of those patterns with the rest of the class.

### Stop and Think

**1:** What changes do you see through the year? What explanations can you suggest for these patterns?  
  
**2:** Choose a location or region. During which months do the extreme highs and lows occur? What explanations can you suggest for the timing of those extremes?  
  
**3:** Which regions experience both the extreme highs and lows? Which regions don't experience the extremes? Why do you think this happens?  
  
**4:** What differences, if any, do you find between the year's variations over the oceans versus the year's variations over the continents?  
  
**5:** Are there regions that remain relatively unchanged over the year? Why do you think this happens?
{% endhint %}

## Part B: Identify Relationships Between Components of the Earth System

In this part of the investigation, you will use animated images from two variables side-by-side, looking for possible relationships that are occurring throughout the most recent complete year.

1. Go to the [NASA Earth Observations \(NEO\) Global Maps website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/global-maps).

2. Select and display the dataset you explored in Lab 5. 

3. Choose a "**Select and Compare"** variable from the sidebar \(you may need to view full screen\).

4. Watch the animation several times through, looking for changes over time.

5.   With your group, identify relationships between the annual cycles for your two variables by answering the following **Stop and Think** questions.

5. Designate a spokesperson to report your group's observations.

6. Share your discoveries of patterns and your interpretation of those patterns with the rest of the class.

### Stop and Think

**1:** What relationships do you see between solar insolation and land surface temperature? Sea surface temperature and solar insolation? Vegetation index and water vapor?  
  
**2:** Do the relationships appear to be directly or inversely proportional? Explain.
