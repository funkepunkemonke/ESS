# How to Study ESS

## Before Lecture: Preview

The key to taking good notes is to arrive in class with an overview of what will be covered already in mind. That way you will already know what geological processes will be explained and what key questions the lecture will answer. In lecture you can actively listen for answers to those questions. Listening actively with specific questions in mind is guaranteed to result in understanding more of what is said and including more of the key points in your notes.

 The method you use to gain an overview is called Chapter Preview. To make previewing easier for you, we begin each chapter with three or four key questions the chapter \(and its corresponding lecture\) will cover. Brief answers designed to help you start thinking about the material are supplied as well. Working with these questions and answers ahead of time will bring you to lecture ready to listen and take good notes.

Before you go to lecture, be sure to spend some time previewing. You will find that as little as 10 to 15 minutes of time spent previewing can make a big difference in how much you understand of the lecture. With the key points already in mind, you can focus in lecture on understanding the details. This, in turn, will help ensure you get an excellent set of notes.

## During Lecture: Take an Excellent Set of Notes

With the basic questions in mind, you have a head start on taking good notes. But note taking is a skill, and as is true with just about everything else in life, you get better with practice. We provide a Note-Taking Checklist: specific actions you can take to get more of the content into your notes in a usable form. For many chapters we provide additional note-taking tips that are specific to the chapter, for example, suggestions about what to listen for or figures you need to review carefully before a particular lecture.

As you listen to lecture, identify questions you need to ask to understand the material. Try to formulate at least one good question you can ask during every lecture.

Your basic goal during lecture is to take good notes. Take notes in a format that makes the main topics and concepts easy to identify. Some students accomplish this by taking notes in outline format. But many other approaches are possible. Visual learners may find it helpful to highlight main points \(after class\) in color.

## After Lecture

After each lecture we suggest that you schedule two separate sessions: a brief note review and improvement session and an Intensive Study Session \(lasting at least an hour\) during which you achieve mastery of the lecture’s content.

**Have you checked your notes?** Note taking is not confined just to lecture. Notes can almost always be improved after lecture. Good students know this and take the time after lecture to revise their notes. These students also pull additional points on every midterm as their “paycheck.” Specific suggestions in every chapter of the Study Guide will help you improve your lecture notes. Often these suggestions focus on adding visual material from the text or summarizing what was covered in a form that will be easy to remember.

**Review Your Notes Immediately.** Good note taking continues after the lecture is over. Right after lecture, while the material is fresh in your mind, is the perfect time to review your notes. Review to be sure you understood the key points and wrote them down in a form that will be easy to review later. Don’t postpone this activity. The best time is right after lecture before you go to your next class or activity. Learning experts tell us that most of us will forget 80 percent of what we heard in a lecture by the following day. On the other hand, if you review right after the lecture, there will have been no interruptions. Much of what was said will still be in your short term memory. If you missed something, you can probably remember it and put it into your notes. The basic idea of reviewing your notes is to fill in what you missed and to add helpful visual material from the text. 

**Intensive Study Session.** The purpose of the intensive study session is to master the material taught in lecture. Learning and cognitive psychology teaches us that reading passively is an inefficient way to learn. You learn best if you spend your study time answering questions. _Ask yourself questions as you study. Then answer them._

With this method you read portions of the text as you need them to find answers to questions. It’s a lot like the way we learn a new software package on the computer. We may not read the software manual first. Instead we load a program and start using it. Then we go to the manual \(or online help\) when we need to find out if we can do something with the program, or to see how to do it. Applying this to the textbook, you will learn Earth Science most efficiently by working backward from questions, and for each chapter we suggest questions you can use this way. Simply stated: Do answer questions, don’t “just read.” You will learn and remember more science much faster.

You should schedule at least one hour after each lecture for intensive study. This can occur anytime before the next lecture. Mastery is not gained by just reading the text. Mastery occurs as the result of asking yourself questions and answering them.



## Clues and Tools: “What’s Important?”

One of the toughest things about taking an introductory course is that you typically have very little knowledge of the subject matter. Not only do you have a lot to learn, but you have a lot to learn about how to learn it. Where should you focus your attention? What skills and concepts should receive the bulk of your study energy? Aids to help you see what material is important are built into every page. But you have to know where to look for these aids and how to use them. Here is a short list of learning aids in your text and a few preliminary thoughts about how to maximize their usefulness.

**Chapter Outline:** The authors begin each chapter with an outline of what will be covered. To use this tool you need to look actively for clues. Look at the outline for Chapter 1. Each item in the outline is a clue to what will be covered in the chapter. Try turning each item in the outline into a question. Example: Ask yourself, “What is the scientific method?” as you read that section. Pay particular attention to material in the outline you find intriguing, surprising, or puzzling in any way. Use your surprise or puzzlement to motivate yourself when you read that section. Example: Consider the item “Earth as a System of Interacting Components.” Here there are two possibilities. You may be puzzled about what components the authors are referring to. In that case, activate your curiosity. Frame your surprise in a question such as “What in the world are the authors talking about?” or “What are Earth’s interacting components?” Read with the question in mind. 

**Chapter Summary:** At the end of each chapter a brief summary emphasizes the most important ideas of the chapter. This is a very useful resource when you are studying for an exam.

**Key Terms:** within the text are printed in bold. You can speed up your reading time by being vigilant for key terms. When you see a boldfaced term you know it is the most important concept in that paragraph. Focus on understanding the concept.

### Text-Marking Strategy

You can make the 30 percent of your study time you spend reading the text even more efficient by skillful text marking. Marking your text as you read is a vital part of learning the material and may be particularly important if you are a kinesthetic learner. The action of marking will aid your kinesthetic memory. If you are a visual learner, you will tend to remember marked sections during exams. Good marking involves both thinking and planning. First, you think about what is important. Then you plan for exam review, deciding which of the marking techniques in the following table will best help you when you return to the chapter during exam review. Only then should you mark. The authors have already marked key terms in bold letters. You will want to add underlines, numbers, and annotations in the margin. 

**Underlining:** Underline important points. Underline to highlight the key ideas. Do pay attention to the key terms that are in boldfaced type in the text. Be selective. Underline brief but meaningful phrases or key words that will trigger your memory. Mark just enough so that you can review without rereading the paragraph.

**Summarizing:** Write a brief summary statement of key processes in your own words in the text margin. Use these annotations to facilitate exam review.

**Annotating**: **Circled numbers** in the margin indicate sequences, such as the processes of the rock cycle. **Question mark?** Put a question mark in the margin to remind yourself to ask your instructor about a point you do not understand. **Asterisks** _**\***_ Use asterisks to mark ideas of special importance. Use asterisks sparingly. Save them for the two or three most vital ideas in the entire chapter. **TQ \(test question\)** Use TQ to mark material in the chapter that you know will be covered on the exam. This will remind you to pay particular attention to these items.

Marking the text will aid kinesthetic learning. Good text marking will aid visual memory— so use caution when marking up your text. Mark carefully and selectively. If you mess up the text with excessive and illegible markings, you may interfere with some of the good memory aids that are built into the careful design of the text. Remember, a well-marked text will make exam review far more efficient because the marks will focus your attention on the key material you need to find and review. If you are worried about the impact of marking on your textbook’s resale value, be sure to ask your bookstore. Many bookstores have policies that encourage effective text marking.
