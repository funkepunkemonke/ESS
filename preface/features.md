A special effort has been made to incorporate features that will facilitate learning and enhance an understanding of science:

* **Chapter Objectives** are presented at the beginning of each chapter that summarize the anticipated learning outcomes
* **Key terms** are boldfaced where defined in the text, and are listed in a comprehensive glossary
* **Images, Videos Figures, and Tables** are abundant throughout, many of them being original analyses of publicly available data, and all with an explanatory caption that is further developed within the text.
* **Questions for Review** are presented at the end of each chapter that provide opportunities to test studentsâ€™ factual and conceptual understanding of the material presented in the chapter.
* **Questions for Discussion** are also presented at the end of each chapter to provide thought-provoking queries that help to stimulate careful reflection and class discussion
* A **comprehensive Index** makes looking up topics easy
