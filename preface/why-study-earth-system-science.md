# Why study Earth system science?

Perceiving Earth as a system begins when we first feel warmth from sunshine or get wet standing in the rain. Understanding Earth as a system – Earth System Science – requires a quantitative exploration of the connections among all parts \(atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere\) of the system.

The processes comprising the global environment are interconnected. Many of the major environmental issues of our time have driven scientists to study how these connections operate on a global basis – to understand Earth as a system. 

Studies of the stratospheric ozone layer involve questions about the processes which create and destroy ozone. Scientists have learned that ozone, a chemical primarily found in a layer centered about 25 km above Earth’s surface, is connected to biological activity happening in the soil on Earth’s surface. Different chemicals, present in the air in trace amounts, control the abundance of ozone in the atmosphere. The sources of these trace constituents include microorganisms in the soil and water, land plants, and even some animals along with human activity.

Scientists studying climate change are also interested in the connections among the different Earth processes. Some of the trace gases in the atmosphere make it more difficult for heat \(infrared radiation\) to escape from Earth’s surface to space. The amounts of these greenhouse gases found in the atmosphere are tied to the physical, chemical, and biological processes taking place in soil and water and on land. They are also influenced by the circulation of the oceans and atmosphere. To predict the future course of the climate we need to understand this detailed fabric of connections. 

Ecologists study the way in which the living and non-living components of an ecosystem interact. Individual organisms and species compete and cooperate with one another. In some cases, interdependence is so strong that different plants and animals cannot reproduce or even exist without each other. There is a web of life with extensive recycling of nutrients, and each organism plays a role. If one component of the ecosystem is changed the effects ripple through the system. 

Indigenous knowledge is incredibly important in environmental education in particular because Indigenous people live so close to the land. Through experience passed down from generation to generation, they have thousands of years of knowledge related to hunting, gathering and observing changes in the landscape. She says that when people are equipped with such knowledge, it helps them make better decisions about policy and development that affects the environment because they know the environment and connect with it.

Scientists do not know all the Earth system connections yet, but they keep working to gain a more complete understanding. 

## Key Concepts

When studying Earth as a system, there are a few key concepts to understand. These are: 

* The Earth is a system made up of components.
* Energy, water, and the chemical elements are stored in various places and forms and are transported and transformed by various processes and cycles.
* Connections among phenomena can be traced through the energy, hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles.
* Phenomena happen on a range of time and spatial scales.
