# PURPOSE OF THE BOOK

Earth system science is rapidly changing the way people study and think about Earth. People have always been concerned with local climate and weather; now they are also concerned with the global climate, and whether humans are causing it to change. People have always been concerned with local water availability and quality; now they are also concerned with the status of water resources and aquatic ecosystems—both freshwater and marine— around the world. From space it can be seen that winds blow dust from the Sahara desert across the Atlantic Ocean; knowing where to look, scientists can detect dust in ocean sediments and discover that it affects life in the Caribbean islands. This holistic way of thinking about interconnections and interrelationships is changing the way scientists study Earth. We have written this book to introduce students to the developing science of the Earth system.

Courses about Earth system science are being taught with increasing frequency in different academic departments. Such courses may have titles such as Global Change, Earth Science, The Global Environment, Planet Earth, or even Environmental Science, but the approach for all of them is increasingly that of studying Earth as an assemblage of interacting parts and processes.

The key to understanding Earth as a system of many parts is to appreciate the interactions between the parts and to understand how energy and matter move around the system. Earth is, to a very close approximation, a closed system; by this we mean that it neither gains nor loses matter, but energy can both enter and leave the system. For the sake of study and measurement we divide Earth into a large number of subsystems, each of which is an open system, meaning that both matter and energy can move back and forth between them. Earth system science, then, is the study of Earth as an assemblage of open systems, and the goal of the science is to eventually understand the interactions among all parts of the assemblage. In this way, the effects throughout the system caused by a perturbation in one part of the assemblage—say, a volcanic eruption, or a rise in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere—can be estimated and forecast. 

The traditional way to study Earth was to consider the various parts in isolation from each other. One group of scientists studied the atmosphere, another group the oceans, still another the geosphere, and yet another, the assemblage of life forms. Communication and interaction between the different groups were once rare. Earth system science is removing barriers, and interdisciplinary interactions today are common among those who study the Earth system.
